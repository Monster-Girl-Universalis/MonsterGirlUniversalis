Among them, the vibrant port city of Natalia stands as a beacon of prosperity and autonomy, its status as a highly autonomous region long accepted but now questioned by the crown.\nAs tension hangs heavy in the air, whispers of discontent and ambition swirl among the courtiers. The time has come for San Ilia to assert its authority and bring Port Natalia back into the fold of royal sovereignty. Thus, with measured determination, emissaries are dispatched to the coastal city, bearing a demand that reverberates with the weight of centuries of tradition and power.\nIn the shadow of the towering fortress that guards the city's harbor, the emissaries deliver their ultimatum with solemn authority. They call upon the leaders of Port Natalia to recognize the sovereignty of San Ilia and to enter into a personal union with the crown. No longer shall Port Natalia stand as a realm apart, but rather as an integral part of the kingdom, bound by the ties of allegiance and duty.\nThe fate of Port Natalia hangs in the balance, the stage is set for a clash of wills and ideals that will shape the course of history.

Reports from the kingdom's diligent spies paint a chilling portrait of the village's descent into moral decay and despair.\nWhispers of disturbing practices echo through the corridors of power, tales of mistreatment of women, corruption festering within the clergy, and the sinister specter of child abuse haunting the village's streets. The once noble ideals of the Ilias faith have been twisted and perverted, leaving a trail of suffering and anguish in their wake.\nAs the plight of the villagers grows ever more dire, the Kingdom of San Ilia can no longer turn a blind eye to the suffering of its people. With a heavy heart and a resolve born of duty, the decision is made to confront the Luddite Village and issue an ultimatum that will shake the foundations of their society.\nThus, under the banner of righteousness and justice, emissaries are dispatched to the village bearing a message from the crown. The ultimatum is clear and uncompromising: the Luddite Village must surrender itself to the authority of San Ilia, forsaking its corrupt ways and embracing the light of truth and progress. Failure to comply will result in the full might of the Holy Church descending upon the village, with the archbishop's residence as the primary target of their righteous fury.\nIn a dimly lit chamber, the corrupt Archbishop of the Luddite Village, trembling with fear and desperation, hastily signs the act of surrender.

As they sift through the remnants of village life and interview any witnesses they can find, they piece together a puzzle fraught with intrigue and danger.\nBut with each revelation comes new questions, and the truth proves elusive as ever.

As they sift through big data and decipher cryptic inscriptions, they stumble upon a truth so profound it sends shivers down their spines.\nThe discovery is as sobering as it is alarming: all parallel worlds are teetering on the brink of ruin, succumbing to chaos and decay at an alarming rate. It becomes clear that following the correct course of history is the only hope of slowing down the spread of destruction, yet even this is a temporary solution, merely treating the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause.\nAmidst the growing sense of urgency, two distinct plans emerge from the depths of the parallel worlds. In the realm ruled by the dark goddess Alice, a sinister plot takes shape: to annihilate all inhabitants of the parallel worlds and transfer their souls to the Monster World, effectively merging the disparate realms into a single entity shrouded in darkness.\nConversely, in the realm of the Angel World governed by the benevolent Goddess Ilias, a contrasting plan emerges: to save only a select few through the Arc Plan, preserving them from the impending cataclysm and offering salvation amidst the chaos.\nAs the researchers grapple with the weight of these revelations, they find themselves at a crossroads, faced with a choice that will shape the destiny of not just their world, but all parallel worlds. The fate of countless lives hangs in the balance, and the path forward is fraught with uncertainty and peril. In this pivotal moment, the researchers must decide where their allegiance lies and what sacrifices they are willing to make in the face of impending oblivion."

As the San Ilia research team meticulously combs through the village, their efforts yield a startling discovery: angel feathers scattered among the abandoned homes and streets, a sign of divine intervention.\nDrawing upon their knowledge of the parallel world ruled by the Goddess Ilias, the researchers begin to piece together the puzzle. It becomes increasingly evident that the disappearance of Rubiana's inhabitants is not a mere coincidence but rather a deliberate act orchestrated by forces beyond mortal comprehension.\nWith mounting excitement and trepidation, the team hypothesizes that seraphs from the realm of Ilias intervened, transporting the entire population of Rubiana to their heavenly domain. The neat orderliness of the village, the absence of any signs of struggle, all point towards a peaceful and orchestrated departure orchestrated by celestial beings.\nAs the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the researchers find themselves on the cusp of a revelation that transcends the boundaries of the known world. The link between Rubiana's disappearance and the parallel world ruled by Ilias becomes clear, offering a glimpse into the intricate web of divine machinations that shape the fate of mortals and immortals alike. Yet, with this newfound insight comes a host of new questions, as the team grapples with the implications of their discovery and the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality."
