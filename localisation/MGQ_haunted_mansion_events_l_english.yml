mt_haunted_house.4.d: "It was many years ago that our ghost scouts discovered the mysterious tower on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. At first we had no insight as to its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which already met its final demise by being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only a single floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers has found a very valuable item - notes from the Master of this tower, none other than La Croix herself, the sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in the original timeline which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further a world will deviate from the original timeline the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct timeline doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox or prevent the worlds from disintegration, leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"

mt_haunted_house.4.a: "Chrome shall talk to Shirome."




mt_haunted_house.1.d: "Our scouting of the first floor of Administrator Tower has been a great success! Our scientists are presenting us with something they call a Beam Scythe. The makina is powerful enough to slice through some of the toughest materials."

mt_haunted_house.2.d: "The Safina Tartarus was a wonder for our apprentices! They found something they have taken to calling a laser pointer, and after diligent research into its inner workings and applications have presented their findings to us."

mt_haunted_house.3.d: "The San Ilia lab was always meant to be ours. It goes without saying that many in our great country were overjoyed to liberate it. But that was not the only source of our joy. Many of our apprentices were gleeful fantasizing about what discoveries they might make with the lab. Today those hopes have been realized. Our scientists have presented us with something they call a Blast Voice Makina. The item allows the user to magnify the loudness and reach of their voice. Now the question remains, how shall we apply it?"
