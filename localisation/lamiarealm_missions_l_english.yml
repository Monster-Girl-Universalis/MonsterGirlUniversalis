At the sight our our powerful monarch Teeny starts to tremble in fear, but $MONARCH$ slowly approches her and gently picks her up, before wiping the tears off Teeny's face.

With the situation explained the mermaid gestures $MONARCH$ to plunge into the cold Natalia waters to cool down, offering assistance in learning how to best propel in the water using her snake tail.
