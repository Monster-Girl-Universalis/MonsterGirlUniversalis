 ###RELIGIONS###
 ilias_light.1.t:0 "Powerful Hero's Revelation"
 ilias_light.1.desc:0 "Recently a well-known Powerful Hero came to our realm. Stories about his travels already circulate around our continent, many kids are fascinated by him, many warriors dream of his fame. A devout baptised servant of Ilias Light, he is determined to reach Hellgondo continent and slay the current Monster Lord. Cheering is echoed through our capital as the hero is walking down the streets.\nWe are left with a choice though - what should we do with this hero? Providing him with the best equipment we can get may be costly but it will definitely bring us closer to fulfilling the will of Goddess herself, while completely ignoring him may disappoint some of our brethren.\nOne of our cunning Macchiavelian advisors offers a third option - he believes this hero is not very smart and we can manipulate him to serve as one of our army generals instead of following the hero's road. What should we do?"
 ilias_light.1.a:0 "He should receive the best equipment in our kingdom!"
 ilias_light.1.b:0 "Ignore this hero."
 ilias_light.1.c:0 "This hero is valuable, we will conscript him."
 ilias_light.2.t:0 "Goddess Ilias is angry"
 ilias_light.2.desc:0 "It is absolutely outrageous! Your people start to forget my commandments, they are doing intercourse with monsters, churches are being abandoned and commoners forget about how important true faith is! As much as I wanted to help your nation, it seems you are not worthy of my grace. I shall deliver Judgment to all the sinners."
 ilias_light.2.a:0 "We will suffer..."
 ilias_light.3.t:0 "Goddess Ilias is content"
 ilias_light.3.desc:0 "I see, I see. Your people have been paying proper respect to their Goddess and followed my commandments. Just as proper paw... ahem  I mean, humans are supposed to. Regardless, I'm satisfied with your people and I shall lend your nation a divine helping hand in these troubled times."
 ilias_light.3.a:0 "That is good."
 ilias_light.4.t:0 "Goddess Ilias is happy"
 ilias_light.4.desc:0 "Oh, that's most pleasant. Your people have been the most devout followers of the Goddess. They didn't violate any of my commandments, church plays a huge role in your society and faith is very strong across the realm. It bothers me that hostile forces are encroaching your nation and my strongest sla... I mean followers are stagnating. I shall grace this nation with my divine power!\nNow go, oh Brave player! Repay all your loans, stabilize the country, hire some mercenaries and turn those pesky rebels and hostile nations to a strawberry fertilizer!"
 ilias_light.4.a:0 "Rejoice! Ilias Vult!"
 ilias_light.5.t:0 "Divine Intervention"
 ilias_light.5.desc:0 "Oh brave Player, can you hear me?\nIt seems you are in a dire situation right now. Your nation is crumbling, your manpower is depleting and corruption is running rampant. How you managed to rule your nation so poorly? Did you not pay attention to your overextension and stability or you just started a retarded war and now doing a nation ruin? Regardless of what you tried to do it seems I need to directly intervene to fix it. Provided your people are worth the divine salvation. I hope they've been worshiping Goddess of Creation enough or else..."
 ilias_light.5.a:0 "Her decision is..."
 ilias_light.5.b:0 "Her decision is..."
 ilias_light.5.c:0 "Her decision is..."
 ilias_light.6.t:0 "Party of Baptized Heroes"
 ilias_light.6.desc:0 "Recently a party of baptized heroes arrived to our capital. They claim to be heading towards Monster Lord Castle to slay its ruler but are in a dire need now. As monsters in our area are too strong for them, heroes are asking for some equipment to proceed further. Is it really worth wasting our resources on each and every weakling claiming to be a hero? Naturally we can ignore them, but leaving Ilias champions in need is generally frowned upon."
 ilias_light.6.a:0 "Support the group of heroes."
 ilias_light.6.b:0 "Ignore them."
 ilias_light.7.t:0 "The Goddess' Blessing"
 ilias_light.7.desc:0 "A radiant aura envelops your realm as a divine blessing from Goddess Ilias descends upon it. The benevolent presence of the Goddess fills the hearts of your people with hope and determination. Faith in the light grows stronger, and the path of righteousness becomes clearer."
 ilias_light.7.a:0 "We embrace the blessing."

 ###DISASTERS###

 mgq_estate_disasters.1.d:0 "We neglected the interests and needs of our monster girls for too long and they grew tired of it. Not wishing to endure any more prejudices from the ruling class, monster girls rallied their own organized opposition and proclaimed their independence!"
 mgq_estate_disasters.1.a:0 "We should have seen that coming..."
 mgq_estate_disasters.1.b:0 "I will be with my people..."

 ###FLAVOR FOR COUNTRIES###
 flavor_hm1.1.t:0 "La Croix Notes"
 flavor_hm1.1.desc:0 "Not long time ago our ghost scouts have discovered a mysterious tower on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. From the beginning we had no insight of its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which is already met its final demise being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only one floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers have found a very valuable item - notes of the Master of this tower, none other then La Croix herself, a sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in original history which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further world will deviate from the original history the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct history doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox and prevent the worlds from desintegration leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"
