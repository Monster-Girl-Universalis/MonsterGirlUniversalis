  MV1_aftermath_of_revolt_desc:0 "For many years, our village suffered under the brutal rule of abusive men. That dark chapter finally ended when our savior Lady Lily came to our defense and shared her power with the women of the village. We executed every one of our oppressors; only those who had treated their wives kindly were spared. Yet, the violence left our village scarred. Now is the time to heal and rebuild."

  MV1_develop_a_burstling_village_title:0 "Burstling Village"
  MV1_develop_a_burstling_village_desc:0 "The long-term restoration efforts have begun to bear fruit. No longer seen as a backwater village known for witch hunts and hatred, Magistea is now a thriving, prosperous settlement. We have even welcomed immigrant witches from distant lands, drawn by the ideals of Lady Lily."
  MV1_open_lilys_university_title:0 "Lily's University"
  MV1_open_lilys_university_desc:0 "To ensure the future of magical education and preserve our newfound values, we must establish Lily's University. This institution will train the next generation of witches and serve as a beacon of knowledge and progress for all of Magistea."
  MV1_magical_supplies_manufactories_title:0 "Magical Manufactories"
  MV1_magical_supplies_manufactories_desc:0 "Our growing population and magical forces need a steady supply of arcane equipment and resources. Constructing manufactories specialized in magical supplies will support both our economy and our military."

  MV1_conscript_witch_apprentices_desc:0 ""Since our split with Lucia, unrest has stirred beneath the surface. Some skilled witches, disillusioned with Lady Lily’s vision, have left. To replenish our ranks and secure our power, we must conscript and train new witch apprentices."
  MV1_deploy_witch_generals_title:0 "Witch Generals"
  MV1_deploy_witch_generals_desc:0 "With a prolonged conflict on the horizon, it is essential to select and train elite witches to lead our armies. These Witch Generals will serve as the guardians and champions of Magistea’s future."
  MV1_demon_hunters_title:0 "Demon Hunters"
  MV1_demon_hunters_desc:0 "To the north lies a land inhabited by the Yoma — powerful monster girls known as Demon Hunters. Though they have remained neutral in our civil strife, they may yet serve as mercenaries for our enemies, as oni once did with Lucia. We must act swiftly to secure or subjugate them."
  MV1_saloon_hill_title:0 "Saloon Hill"
  MV1_saloon_hill_desc:0 "At the northernmost edge of the Safina continent lies Saloon Hill, a dry and rugged region home to scattered monster tribes. Now that Lady Lily has unified Magistea, it is time to look beyond and bring civilization to these untamed lands."

  MV1_tower_of_magic_title:0 "Tower of Magic"
  MV1_tower_of_magic_desc:0 "After the initial Worm Summoner uprising against our resentful oppressors, Lucia fought alongside Lady Lily. But soon after justice was delivered to the wicked, she grew disillusioned. Disturbed by what she called 'lynchings,' she claimed that power granted too freely would simply reverse the roles of oppressor and oppressed. Insisting that worm summoning magic must be restricted, she left the village with her followers and took refuge in the Tower of Magic. The uneasy ceasefire cannot last. War is inevitable and we must be ready."
  MV1_continuation_war_title:0 "Continuation War"

  MV1_pacification_of_rebels_title:0 "Pacification of Rebels"
  MV1_pacification_of_rebels_desc:0 "Though the rebellion has been quelled and the Tower of Magic subdued, remnants of dissidence still linger.

  MV1_restore_trade_flow_title:0 "Restore Trade Flow"
  MV1_restore_trade_flow_desc:0 "In recent years, our village endured isolation and regressed to the days of the Witch Hunts.

  MV1_hear_voices_of_oppressed_title:0 "Voices of Oppressed"
  MV1_hear_voices_of_oppressed_desc:0 "Lady Lily often hears the voices of the oppressed — distant, desperate cries echoing from lands far beyond our village. Even outside Magistea, the weak suffer under the rule of the strong. We must not rest. A crusade for liberation awaits.\n§YWe will declare war on all of our neighbours holding provinces with separatism.§!"
  MV1_research_of_holy_power_title:0 "Research of Holy Power"
  MV1_research_of_holy_power_desc:0 "Following the Great Disaster that split the Sentora landmass, a mysterious Snow Continent emerged from the sea or so it seemed. Recent reports from spies and merchants traveling through the northern passage suggest that this land is in fact the Former Heaven, now fallen to Earth. Lady Lily has taken great interest in this phenomenon and seeks to study the area, where holy power is densely concentrated, to further her understanding of divine magic.\n§GCompleting this mission gives us a special privilege for burghers.§!"

###FLAVOR FOR LILY'S FACTION###
 flavor_MV1.1.t:0 "Lily's Isolation"
 flavor_MV1.1.desc:0 "For a long time, the former Witch Hunt village was ruled by a group of cruel, abusive men who turned the lives of local women into a living hell.\nNot long ago, Lily the daughter of a local noble and a secret student of magical science discovered a powerful technique known as 'worm summoning'. It was a shortcut to power, a force that allowed the weak to strike back against their tormentors with overwhelming might. What followed was a massive uprising and a wave of brutal lynchings. While many worm summoners celebrated their liberation, others were appalled by the chaos. Among them was Lucia, who formed a faction committed to strictly regulating the spread of tentacle magic.\nAs tensions grew between former comrades, dissidents opposed to Lily’s rule joined Lucia, establishing their base in the Tower of Magic. Once a remote and semi-autonomous village on the fringes of the Sabasa Kingdom, Magistea became even more isolated from the outside world. Trade collapsed, diplomatic missions ceased, and distrust between the two factions deepened. A full-scale civil war now looms on the horizon..."
 flavor_MV1.1.a:0 "The horror!"
 flavor_MV1.2.t:0 "Magistea Unification"
 flavor_MV1.2.desc:0 "After years of internal strife and ideological conflict, Magistea has finally been reunited under Lady Lily's banner. The struggle was long and painful, but the dream of freeing the weak from oppression has prevailed. Though some once-close allies strayed into fear and repression, Lily never abandoned her vision of a world where the weak wield the power to fight back. The voices of the oppressed, once silenced, now echo through the streets of Magistea! With unification achieved, the work begins to rebuild not just the village, but a future founded on true freedom.\nThe age of fear is over, a new age of liberation dawns."
 flavor_MV1.2.a:0 "Peace at last"
