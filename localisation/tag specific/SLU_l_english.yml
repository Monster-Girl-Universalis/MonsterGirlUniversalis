 SLU_mission_3_3_desc: "Our harsh journey into the frozen lands of the south pole has yielded an unexpected suprise; a tiny kingdom of Ice Witch Yomas!

 SLU_mission_3_4_title: "March through the Ice"
 SLU_mission_3_4_desc: "The icy frontier has proven to be much more valuable than initially thought, but we have explored less than half of the frozen continent, it is time we step up our colonial effots."

 SLU_mission_4_3_title: "Metal Slugs"

 SLU_mission_4_4_desc: "At long last the goldmines of Midas are ours!

 SLU_mission_4_7_title: "Papermaking in Enrika"
 SLU_mission_4_7_desc: "The lost Woods posseses a vast quantity of trees as far as the eye can see, combined with the dark and humid enviroment this makes for a perfect location to expand our slug brand of papermaking, the mass production of paper will be crucial in facilitating the burocracy of our growing state, as such we must send manpower in heavely wooded areas to start collecting logs, with our innate connection to mother nature will also ensure that we harvest this resource without damaging the local ecosystem."

 SLU_mission_2_1_desc: "North of Midas village lies the slugs nations of our dear sister Elisabeth and Melty, who have now come under threat by the Midas humans because of the recent slug boom, we must reach out to our brethren and make them understand that we must stand together if we to survive the might of the humans."

slu_army_professionalism_title: "Slug Swordsmanship"
slu_army_professionalism_desc: "We excel at sword and rapier skills while our mucus-covered bodies make for great defense against blunt attacks from other blades, we must make use of our strenghts if we are to vanquish our foes."

slug_magic_title: "Spellsword Mastery"
slug_magic_desc: ""Spellsword" is an advanced job unlocked by mastering both the Warrior and Magician jobs. It is a job that combines the warrior's strength with the dark magic of magicians, but becoming expert magicians might be tricky for us slugs. We need to hone our magic abilities either in war, grinding our skills in training locations, or by studying magical books. In the latter case the libraries of Iliasport and San Ilia are good locations to get started. We need only a few books, so maybe the library is willing to lend us."

A royal visit was schedule in the slime lands and her highness $MONARCH$ was already in a bad mood at the idea of meeting slimes, and ones that would be resent the monarch that subjugated their states no less, but instead $MONARCH$ was met by a most bizzare sight; Slime girls playing with boomerangs, fishing happily in crystal clear river waters and singing joyous chores, and most unusual of all they welcome the sight of our great slug monarch and even went so far as offering their fish to her...perhaps the prosperity bought by our realm has made these slimes too gay to care about such details?

flavor_slu.6_desc: "The village of Midas is renowned for three things; Goldsmithing, animal husbandry and the legendary maid Flora...and also a massive slug boom. While slugs have always lived here in recent times their numbers have exploded to the point of overrunning the village, this has cause not few issues with the local human population which has come to see slugs as pests and alas, now their worst nightmare has become a reality; a slug monarch now rules over them.

They ask us to put on a performance on their stage in Grandeur, We'll have to organized a team to put on a spectacle worthy of our nation, and the trek to Grandeur through the sandy desert will test our mettle as slugs, but this might be a good chance to increase our prestige as a new power on the world stage."

While this is just normality for beings that live in the salty ocean, acquiring this aptitude will be a game changer for us slugs, not least because we could finally overcome our salt weakness on land, but this would allows us to better commit ourselves to future naval exploits. As such we have arranged for DNA extraction from our slimy sea dwellers subjects, and while we're at it we should ask them to teach us the way of water."
