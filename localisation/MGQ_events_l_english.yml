 white_rabbit_tips.300.t:0 "Vanilla Estates"
 white_rabbit_tips.300.desc:0 "Really? Vanilla? Okay, okay, no judging! So these are just like in the base game - you’ve got your classic Clergy, Nobility, and Burghers. Most countries use them. Buuut! Some special nations can get unique privileges added on top, so it’s always smart to peek into your estate menu!\nSome of those cool perks only pop up after doing specific mission trees, and some stay hidden until you meet fancy conditions like §Rbeing at war with a certain nation§!. If that condition ends, poof! The privilege disappears too. Other than that, vanilla estates work just like normal!"
 white_rabbit_tips.301.t:0 "Monster Girls"
 white_rabbit_tips.301.desc:0 "Now we’re talkin’! Monster Girls represent the heart of monsterkind and are super common in many countries. Angels don’t usually get them unless they’ve got a special kind of government, of course.\nThese girls bring both perks and drawbacks, so it’s smart to manage their loyalty well. Get it high enough, and bam! You get a juicy §G+25%§! Improve Relations bonus! That’s some serious charm.\nAnd check this out: some privileges, like ‘Encourage Succubi to Settle,’ unlock brand new agendas you’d never see otherwise!"
 white_rabbit_tips.302.t:0 "Angels"
 white_rabbit_tips.302.desc:0 "Angels were made by Ilias and include both the usual celestials and fallen angels. Their privileges depend on what kind of angel you’re dealing with.\nThere’s even a rare type Apoptosis Angels who’ve got unique privileges.\nHumans and Monster Girls don’t get this estate normally unless they go through some special changes in government reforms. But if you’ve got angel loyalty soaring, you’ll love the Aggressive Expansion Reduction they give!"
 white_rabbit_tips.303.t:0 "Spiritualists"
 white_rabbit_tips.303.desc:0 "Magic and more magic! Spiritualists are all about summoning and fancy spells. You won’t find them everywhere - only special types like top-tier Undead, Ghosts, or Dolls usually have them.\nIf you’re lucky enough to get ‘em, they can raise Zombie armies (yes, really!) that don’t cost manpower. Plus, there’s §GTime Magic§! to mess with movement speed, boost your army, and break down forts faster... at a cost.\nKeep ‘em loyal, and they’ll make your army train and heal up way quicker!"
 white_rabbit_tips.304.t:0 "Apoptosis"
 white_rabbit_tips.304.desc:0 "Apoptosis are like cosmic cleaners wiping out paradoxes and unwanted visitors from other worlds. Most nations don’t get this estate unless they’re, y’know, Chaos religion types with the right government setup.\nInstead of lots of estates, they usually have just this one, but it’s packed with powerful military and utility bonuses as well as monarch points. They also get extra stuff based on which Apoptosis cultures they’ve accepted! So if you build a big Apoptosis empire, you get all kinds of fun toys to play with!"

 white_rabbit_tips.509.t:0 "Dark Goddess Worship"
 white_rabbit_tips.509.desc:0 "This one uses Patriarch Authority and vanilla-style icons. Pick an icon and get random events from one of the Great Six Ancestors! That means mana points, strong modifiers, or weird things happening in your provinces. Surprise!"

 white_rabbit_tips.510.desc:0 "Oooh, naughty! Rogue Magicraft is the techy-magic mess Kagetsumugi loves.\nJust like the Seekers of Truth, it uses Holy Sites and lets you play with heretic techs and race-changing items.

 white_rabbit_tips.6.desc:0 "Oho~ Curious about technology groups, are we? Well, there’s quite a few of them, but honestly? Most aren’t that different when it comes to military pips.\nMonsters and Angels usually share similar units — they just look and sound different. Oh, and monsters don’t really do cavalry. Nope, no horsies here.\nHumans, though? They get more variety, especially with mounted units and infantry types. Depending on your tech level, sometimes monsters hit harder, sometimes humans pull ahead. It's a back and forth, really!\nNow Apoptosis... hooo boy, they’re another story. They start at tech level 4 right from the year 1444, and their units? Total nightmares. We're talking §G4 pips§! at tech 1, §G6 pips§! at tech 5, and by tech 26?

 ilias_light.1.desc:0 "Recently a well-known Powerful Hero came to our realm. Stories about his travels already circulate around our continent, many kids are fascinated by him, many warriors dream of his fame. A devout baptised servant of Ilias Light, he is determined to reach Hellgondo continent and slay the current Monster Lord. Cheering is echoed through our capital as the hero is walking down the streets.\nWe are left with a choice though - what should we do with this hero? Providing him with the best equipment we can get may be costly but it will definitely bring us closer to fulfilling the will of Goddess herself, while completely ignoring him may disappoint some of our brethren.\nOne of our cunning Macchiavelian advisors offers a third option - he believes this hero is not very smart and we can manipulate him to serve as one of our army generals instead of following the hero's road. What should we do?"

How you managed to rule your nation so poorly? Did you not pay attention to your overextension and stability or you just started a retarded war and now doing a nation ruin? Regardless of what you tried to do it seems I need to directly intervene to fix it. Provided your people are worth the divine salvation. I hope they've been worshiping Goddess of Creation enough or else..."

As monsters in our area are too strong for them, heroes are asking for some equipment to proceed further. Is it really worth wasting our resources on each and every weakling claiming to be a hero? Naturally we can ignore them, but leaving Ilias champions in need is generally frowned upon."

 flavor_hm1.1.desc:0 "Not long time ago our ghost scouts have discovered a mysterious tower on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. From the beginning we had no insight of its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which is already met its final demise being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only one floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers have found a very valuable item - notes of the Master of this tower, none other then La Croix herself, a sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in original history which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further world will deviate from the original history the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct history doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox and prevent the worlds from desintegration leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"

Among them, the vibrant port city of Natalia stands as a beacon of prosperity and autonomy, its status as a highly autonomous region long accepted but now questioned by the crown.\nAs tension hangs heavy in the air, whispers of discontent and ambition swirl among the courtiers. The time has come for San Ilia to assert its authority and bring Port Natalia back into the fold of royal sovereignty. Thus, with measured determination, emissaries are dispatched to the coastal city, bearing a demand that reverberates with the weight of centuries of tradition and power.\nIn the shadow of the towering fortress that guards the city's harbor, the emissaries deliver their ultimatum with solemn authority. They call upon the leaders of Port Natalia to recognize the sovereignty of San Ilia and to enter into a personal union with the crown. No longer shall Port Natalia stand as a realm apart, but rather as an integral part of the kingdom, bound by the ties of allegiance and duty.\nThe fate of Port Natalia hangs in the balance, the stage is set for a clash of wills and ideals that will shape the course of history. Will the city bend to the will of San Ilia and embrace the bonds of union, or will it stand firm in defense of its autonomy and sovereignty? The answer lies in the hands of those who call Port Natalia home, as they weigh the cost of submission against the price of defiance."

 flavor_si1.3.desc:0 "In the solemn halls of power within the Kingdom of San Ilia, a grave matter has come to light, casting a shadow over the realm's conscience and demanding decisive action. Deep within the heart of the countryside lies the secluded Luddite Village, a realm shrouded in secrecy and darkness. Reports from the kingdom's diligent spies paint a chilling portrait of the village's descent into moral decay and despair.\nWhispers of disturbing practices echo through the corridors of power, tales of mistreatment of women, corruption festering within the clergy, and the sinister specter of child abuse haunting the village's streets. The once noble ideals of the Ilias faith have been twisted and perverted, leaving a trail of suffering and anguish in their wake.\nAs the plight of the villagers grows ever more dire, the Kingdom of San Ilia can no longer turn a blind eye to the suffering of its people. With a heavy heart and a resolve born of duty, the decision is made to confront the Luddite Village and issue an ultimatum that will shake the foundations of their society.\nThus, under the banner of righteousness and justice, emissaries are dispatched to the village bearing a message from the crown. The ultimatum is clear and uncompromising: the Luddite Village must surrender itself to the authority of San Ilia, forsaking its corrupt ways and embracing the light of truth and progress. Failure to comply will result in the full might of the Holy Church descending upon the village, with the archbishop's residence as the primary target of their righteous fury.\nIn a dimly lit chamber, the corrupt Archbishop of the Luddite Village, trembling with fear and desperation, hastily signs the act of surrender. Knowing his own guilt and fearing the wrath of San Ilia's forces, he sacrifices his authority and thus anti-makina faction is effectively destroyed."

The streets are littered with the fallen, their lifeless bodies serving as grim reminders of the succubi's merciless onslaught. Families are torn apart, their loved ones stolen away by the ravenous hunger of the Lilith Sisters.\nAs they stand on the brink of uncertainty, the villagers know that their journey is far from over. The threat of the Lilith Sisters still looms large, their shadow casting a pall over the once-thriving community.

The eerie scene, with houses left in a meticulously orderly fashion, suggests that the villagers departed of their own accord, but the question of why remains unanswered.\nDespite the efforts of previous investigators, the truth behind the disappearance eludes discovery, shrouding Rubiana in an unsettling aura of uncertainty. In light of this enigma, the Kingdom of San Ilia has resolved to dispatch its own team of researchers to unravel the mystery once and for all.\nArmed with determination and a thirst for answers, the San Ilia research team delves into the heart of Rubiana, scouring every corner for clues and uncovering secrets hidden beneath the surface. As they sift through the remnants of village life and interview any witnesses they can find, they piece together a puzzle fraught with intrigue and danger.\nBut with each revelation comes new questions, and the truth proves elusive as ever. Were the villagers compelled to leave by some unseen force, or did they willingly abandon their homes for reasons unknown? As the investigation unfolds, the team finds themselves drawn deeper into the mystery of Rubiana, where the line between reality and myth begins to blur, and the answers they seek may lie in the realm of the inconceivable."

As they sift through big data and decipher cryptic inscriptions, they stumble upon a truth so profound it sends shivers down their spines.\nThe discovery is as sobering as it is alarming: all parallel worlds are teetering on the brink of ruin, succumbing to chaos and decay at an alarming rate. It becomes clear that following the correct course of history is the only hope of slowing down the spread of destruction, yet even this is a temporary solution, merely treating the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause.\nAmidst the growing sense of urgency, two distinct plans emerge from the depths of the parallel worlds. In the realm ruled by the dark goddess Alice, a sinister plot takes shape: to annihilate all inhabitants of the parallel worlds and transfer their souls to the Monster World, effectively merging the disparate realms into a single entity shrouded in darkness.\nConversely, in the realm of the Angel World governed by the benevolent Goddess Ilias, a contrasting plan emerges: to save only a select few through the Arc Plan, preserving them from the impending cataclysm and offering salvation amidst the chaos.\nAs the researchers grapple with the weight of these revelations, they find themselves at a crossroads, faced with a choice that will shape the destiny of not just their world, but all parallel worlds. The fate of countless lives hangs in the balance, and the path forward is fraught with uncertainty and peril. In this pivotal moment, the researchers must decide where their allegiance lies and what sacrifices they are willing to make in the face of impending oblivion."

As the San Ilia research team meticulously combs through the village, their efforts yield a startling discovery: angel feathers scattered among the abandoned homes and streets, a sign of divine intervention.\nDrawing upon their knowledge of the parallel world ruled by the Goddess Ilias, the researchers begin to piece together the puzzle. It becomes increasingly evident that the disappearance of Rubiana's inhabitants is not a mere coincidence but rather a deliberate act orchestrated by forces beyond mortal comprehension.\nWith mounting excitement and trepidation, the team hypothesizes that seraphs from the realm of Ilias intervened, transporting the entire population of Rubiana to their heavenly domain. The neat orderliness of the village, the absence of any signs of struggle, all point towards a peaceful and orchestrated departure orchestrated by celestial beings.\nAs the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the researchers find themselves on the cusp of a revelation that transcends the boundaries of the known world. The link between Rubiana's disappearance and the parallel world ruled by Ilias becomes clear, offering a glimpse into the intricate web of divine machinations that shape the fate of mortals and immortals alike. Yet, with this newfound insight comes a host of new questions, as the team grapples with the implications of their discovery and the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality."

Although much about these rifts remains shrouded in mystery, we have found reports of two individuals traveling through the spacetime doors: Luka and his father, Marcellus! It seems that South Ilias Tartarus leads to a world where Iliasville was destroyed, along with all humanity and monsters, as the Goddess Ilias's sinister re-creation plan took hold. Meanwhile, East Ilias Tartarus leads to a world similar to our own, but a few years behind, where Rostrum village has yet to be destroyed.\nWhat should we do?\nWe can focus on analyzing the data from the world destroyed by the angels to prepare powerful countermeasures for war against the Goddess. \n§GThis path will grant military buffs for the nobility, which could prove invaluable in the war to come.§!\nAlternatively, we could uncover the secrets of refining magic stones and mass-produce them. \n§GThis would provide military buffs for the burgher estate, enabling us to equip certain elemental stones.§!"

A ruined temple, and otherworldly erosion spreading through what was once a divine place. Chimeric monsters and Angel Apoptosis roam among its floors...\nWhen Micaela finally arrives at the center of this anomaly, she sees the Goddess. Ilias stands there, weakened, her body slowly eroding from the chaos. For all those years after the Great Disaster, she had used her goddess powers to hold back the otherworldly erosion. But now, her power seems to be running out.\nSuddenly, a party of heroes, led by Luka, unexpectedly appears at the final layer of the Temple Ruins, accompanied by two groups: the Lilith Sisters from the Demon World and Seraphs from the Angel World. After that...\nNone of our soldiers seem to remember what happened next. It was as if time had frozen, but everyone remembers an ominous feeling, as though the world had almost been destroyed. The same sense of dread one experiences deep in the Tartarus rifts, fighting the strongest types of Apoptosis.\nBefore us stand Luka, his childhood friend Sonya, and the other party members. The Goddess Ilias is no more, but it seems a great threat has been averted as the otherworldly erosion has stopped spreading. The young hero refuses to talk about what happened during that time, but it seems everything has been resolved."
