 HOLY_SITE_20_DESC: "Eastern Ilias Continent Tartarus is a rather peculiar place. One of the many Tartarus rifts which appeared in our world after The Great Disaster. There have been reports of abnormal crops growth, as well as mutated fish. According to the most experienced researchers, this rift may lead to a parallel world a few years behind our own. In that world the village of Rostrum should still exist..."
 HOLY_SITE_58_DESC: "Southern Ilias Continent Tartarus is yet another mysterious rift which appeared after the Great Disaster. Recently it's been thoroughly investigated by a group of researchers from Iliasburg and Iliasport. The Alliance of Wisdom society has managed to gather even more information on this subject.

After the teleportation to our world the upper floors got caught in debris. It is safe to assume that this world has been covered in chaos, perhaps high-ranking XX-class Apoptosis is to blame..."
