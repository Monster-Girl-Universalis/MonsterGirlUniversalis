 ilias_light.1.desc:0 "Recently a well-known Powerful Hero came to our realm. Stories about his travels already circulate around our continent, many kids are fascinated by him, many warriors dream of his fame. A devout baptised servant of Ilias Light, he is determined to reach Hellgondo continent and slay the current Monster Lord. Cheering is echoed through our capital as the hero is walking down the streets.\nWe are left with a choice though - what should we do with this hero? Providing him with the best equipment we can get may be costly but it will definitely bring us closer to fulfilling the will of Goddess herself, while completely ignoring him may disappoint some of our brethren.\nOne of our cunning Macchiavelian advisors offers a third option - he believes this hero is not very smart and we can manipulate him to serve as one of our army generals instead of following the hero's road. What should we do?"
 ilias_light.1.a:0 "He should receive the best equipment in our kingdom!"

Your people start to forget my commandments, they are doing intercourse with monsters, churches are being abandoned and commoners forget about how important true faith is! As much as I wanted to help your nation, it seems you are not worthy of my grace. I shall deliver Judgment to all the sinners."

 ilias_light.4.t:0 "Goddess Ilias is happy"
 ilias_light.4.desc:0 "Oh, that's most pleasant. Your people have been the most devout followers of the Goddess. They didn't violate any of my commandments, church plays a huge role in your society and faith is very strong across the realm. It bothers me that hostile forces are encroaching your nation and my strongest sla... I mean followers are stagnating. I shall grace this nation with my divine power!\nNow go, oh Brave player!

How you managed to rule your nation so poorly? Did you not pay attention to your overextension and stability or you just started a retarded war and now doing a nation ruin? Regardless of what you tried to do it seems I need to directly intervene to fix it. Provided your people are worth the divine salvation.

 flavor_hm1.1.t:0 "La Croix Notes"
 flavor_hm1.1.desc:0 "Not long time ago our ghost scouts have discovered a mysterious tower on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. From the beginning we had no insight of its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which is already met its final demise being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only one floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers have found a very valuable item - notes of the Master of this tower, none other then La Croix herself, a sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in original history which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further world will deviate from the original history the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct history doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox and prevent the worlds from desintegration leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"

The air thickened with acrid smoke, swirling in ghostly tendrils as the aftermath of the failed assassination attempt against His Holiness, the Pope, unfolded.\nIn the hallowed chambers where reverence and piety once reigned supreme, the ground quivered beneath the weight of treachery. The echoes of the detonation reverberated through the corridors, a chilling reminder of the fragility of peace in the face of malice. The Pope, beacon of divine guidance and symbol of unity, stood resolute amidst the chaos, his unwavering faith a bastion against the shadows that sought to engulf him.\nYet, amidst the chaos and confusion, a glimmer of hope flickered in the darkness. Fortunately, His Holiness managed to survive that blow, though he might need the cutting-edge makina to recover..."

Among them, the vibrant port city of Natalia stands as a beacon of prosperity and autonomy, its status as a highly autonomous region long accepted but now questioned by the crown.\nAs tension hangs heavy in the air, whispers of discontent and ambition swirl among the courtiers. The time has come for San Ilia to assert its authority and bring Port Natalia back into the fold of royal sovereignty. Thus, with measured determination, emissaries are dispatched to the coastal city, bearing a demand that reverberates with the weight of centuries of tradition and power.\nIn the shadow of the towering fortress that guards the city's harbor, the emissaries deliver their ultimatum with solemn authority. They call upon the leaders of Port Natalia to recognize the sovereignty of San Ilia and to enter into a personal union with the crown. No longer shall Port Natalia stand as a realm apart, but rather as an integral part of the kingdom, bound by the ties of allegiance and duty.\nThe fate of Port Natalia hangs in the balance, the stage is set for a clash of wills and ideals that will shape the course of history. Will the city bend to the will of San Ilia and embrace the bonds of union, or will it stand firm in defense of its autonomy and sovereignty? The answer lies in the hands of those who call Port Natalia home, as they weigh the cost of submission against the price of defiance."

Deep within the heart of the countryside lies the secluded Luddite Village, a realm shrouded in secrecy and darkness. Reports from the kingdom's diligent spies paint a chilling portrait of the village's descent into moral decay and despair.\nWhispers of disturbing practices echo through the corridors of power, tales of mistreatment of women, corruption festering within the clergy, and the sinister specter of child abuse haunting the village's streets. The once noble ideals of the Ilias faith have been twisted and perverted, leaving a trail of suffering and anguish in their wake.\nAs the plight of the villagers grows ever more dire, the Kingdom of San Ilia can no longer turn a blind eye to the suffering of its people. With a heavy heart and a resolve born of duty, the decision is made to confront the Luddite Village and issue an ultimatum that will shake the foundations of their society.\nThus, under the banner of righteousness and justice, emissaries are dispatched to the village bearing a message from the crown. The ultimatum is clear and uncompromising: the Luddite Village must surrender itself to the authority of San Ilia, forsaking its corrupt ways and embracing the light of truth and progress. Failure to comply will result in the full might of the Holy Church descending upon the village, with the archbishop's residence as the primary target of their righteous fury.\nIn a dimly lit chamber, the corrupt Archbishop of the Luddite Village, trembling with fear and desperation, hastily signs the act of surrender. Knowing his own guilt and fearing the wrath of San Ilia's forces, he sacrifices his authority and thus anti-makina faction is effectively destroyed."

The eerie scene, with houses left in a meticulously orderly fashion, suggests that the villagers departed of their own accord, but the question of why remains unanswered.\nDespite the efforts of previous investigators, the truth behind the disappearance eludes discovery, shrouding Rubiana in an unsettling aura of uncertainty. In light of this enigma, the Kingdom of San Ilia has resolved to dispatch its own team of researchers to unravel the mystery once and for all.\nArmed with determination and a thirst for answers, the San Ilia research team delves into the heart of Rubiana, scouring every corner for clues and uncovering secrets hidden beneath the surface. As they sift through the remnants of village life and interview any witnesses they can find, they piece together a puzzle fraught with intrigue and danger.\nBut with each revelation comes new questions, and the truth proves elusive as ever. Were the villagers compelled to leave by some unseen force, or did they willingly abandon their homes for reasons unknown? As the investigation unfolds, the team finds themselves drawn deeper into the mystery of Rubiana, where the line between reality and myth begins to blur, and the answers they seek may lie in the realm of the inconceivable."

 flavor_si1.7.desc:0 "In the depths of a secret laboratory hidden within ancient ruins, researchers uncover a revelation that shakes the very foundations of their understanding of the world. As they sift through big data and decipher cryptic inscriptions, they stumble upon a truth so profound it sends shivers down their spines.\nThe discovery is as sobering as it is alarming: all parallel worlds are teetering on the brink of ruin, succumbing to chaos and decay at an alarming rate. It becomes clear that following the correct course of history is the only hope of slowing down the spread of destruction, yet even this is a temporary solution, merely treating the symptoms rather than addressing the underlying cause.\nAmidst the growing sense of urgency, two distinct plans emerge from the depths of the parallel worlds. In the realm ruled by the dark goddess Alice, a sinister plot takes shape: to annihilate all inhabitants of the parallel worlds and transfer their souls to the Monster World, effectively merging the disparate realms into a single entity shrouded in darkness.\nConversely, in the realm of the Angel World governed by the benevolent Goddess Ilias, a contrasting plan emerges: to save only a select few through the Arc Plan, preserving them from the impending cataclysm and offering salvation amidst the chaos.\nAs the researchers grapple with the weight of these revelations, they find themselves at a crossroads, faced with a choice that will shape the destiny of not just their world, but all parallel worlds. The fate of countless lives hangs in the balance, and the path forward is fraught with uncertainty and peril. In this pivotal moment, the researchers must decide where their allegiance lies and what sacrifices they are willing to make in the face of impending oblivion."

As the San Ilia research team meticulously combs through the village, their efforts yield a startling discovery: angel feathers scattered among the abandoned homes and streets, a sign of divine intervention.\nDrawing upon their knowledge of the parallel world ruled by the Goddess Ilias, the researchers begin to piece together the puzzle. It becomes increasingly evident that the disappearance of Rubiana's inhabitants is not a mere coincidence but rather a deliberate act orchestrated by forces beyond mortal comprehension.\nWith mounting excitement and trepidation, the team hypothesizes that seraphs from the realm of Ilias intervened, transporting the entire population of Rubiana to their heavenly domain. The neat orderliness of the village, the absence of any signs of struggle, all point towards a peaceful and orchestrated departure orchestrated by celestial beings.\nAs the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the researchers find themselves on the cusp of a revelation that transcends the boundaries of the known world. The link between Rubiana's disappearance and the parallel world ruled by Ilias becomes clear, offering a glimpse into the intricate web of divine machinations that shape the fate of mortals and immortals alike. Yet, with this newfound insight comes a host of new questions, as the team grapples with the implications of their discovery and the mysteries that lie beyond the veil of reality."
