Muslim merchants now make deeper inroads into the countryside of our and traveling Sufis have become a more common sight among our settlements. At times it is possible to track the path of such holy men by the converts they leave behind as they move from one area to the next. Some of these men are already famous when they come to our lands and possess a way to mobilize the heart and will of men to follow a ruler they see as just.\nOne particularly famous Sufi teacher has recently arrived in our lands."

He says that he is willing to settle in our lands for a while and act his old profession, dispensing justice according to the Sharia, ensuring law and order in our lands. This would no doubt be popular, especially among the Muslim community in our country. His experience in other countries might also help centralize our realm."

[Root.Monarch.GetName] has [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] shown great interest in the foreign religion but still practices many of the rituals of our ancestors. Perhaps it is because [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] takes such interest in them that the Muslim community itself has come to scrutinize the life and actions of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The Muslim community leaders question whether [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] decisions are really made with the best interests of them and their god in mind."

 tengri_events.15.d: "With the increasing influence of Islam, especially in our growing cities, the older legal codes such as the Yassa have increasingly come to be abandoned in favor of the Sharia that our Muslim urban dwellers prefer.\nThis development has recently resulted in a heated legal battle in [Root.GetName] where an important warrior from a local clan is insisting on his rights according to tradition while the urban establishment is insisting on following the Sharia. Supporting one side over the other will undoubtedly have repercussions for the development of the entire area."

 tengri_events.15.b: "Appoint someone to judge according to our traditions."
 tengri_events.16.t: "Popular Sufi Teacher"
 tengri_events.16.d: "A teacher of a lineage of famous Sufis has recently gained increasing popularity in our lands. His teachings have not only won the ears of our Muslim communities but also have deeply impressed the more traditional warrior elites. Many that listen to his words will still not forsake the Tengri Shamans but the teacher's charismatic personality ensures that even so they will value every word of this 'Khoja'. A local noble that managed to come into conflict with the Khoja lost so badly he had to abandon his lands.\nSo far the Khoja have been quietly supporting our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], perhaps he could be persuaded to support the throne a bit more openly if we grant him land and an official title at our court?"

 tengri_events.17.d: "The power of the Khoja lineage over our subjects is almost too great. They are constantly meddling in legal cases, religious policy and the day-to-day business of our country. The Khoja is, however, still one of the most valiant supporters of the throne. With the crowning of [Root.Monarch.GetName] we will be expected to affirm the ties to the Khoja and perhaps extend his privileges even further."
 tengri_events.17.a: "He remains our strongest supporter."

 tengri_events.17.b: "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khojas."
 tengri_events.17.b.tt: "This will weaken the influence of the Khojas and their chances to take power in the future."

 tengri_events.18.d: "Not content to continue to serve as the power behind the throne the current head of the Khoja lineage has today declared himself to be more fit to rule than any [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. His followers are massing on the outskirts of our capital as well as in the countryside attempting to create a state built directly upon the teachings of their charismatic Sufi teacher."

Small groups of Shiites have begun to arrive in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking to help build and protect a state for those that honor the Imams.\nTheir services might come in quite handy but our Shamans are apprehensive about allowing what they see as foreign zealots to settle among our people."

 tengri_events.21.d: "In their desire to spread their faith and incorporate the [Root.GetName] realm into the wider Buddhist world some monks have taken it upon themselves to translate many Buddhist historical, philosophical and religious works for the benefit of our people. These manuscripts have opened the eyes of many to a new spiritual world as well as given us a better understanding of the surrounding world in general. Among the nobility collecting these manuscripts has become fashionable, though some would say not always for spiritual reasons."
 tengri_events.21.a: "Welcome the dissemination of these books."
 tengri_events.21.b: "We must honor our ancient traditions instead."

 tengri_events.22.d: "Strange tales are reaching us from the provinces of a traveling Buddhist Monk using his wisdom to overcome various problems and spreading his faith among the many people benefiting from his help. Not everyone is happy with these advances among the common people, however, as they often involve defeating the local Shamans.\nIn [Root.GetName] this monk reportedly defeated a local Shaman and cured a local princess from a severe malady, leaving the traditional rituals appearing poor and insufficient. As a result the local lord has banned traditional rituals in his lands and is instead promoting [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName]."

 tengri_events.23.d: "For some time Vajrayana monks have been gaining followers in the province of [Root.GetName] and while their influence is still quite limited they have apparently taken it upon themselves to go one step further in their missionary activity. Reports are reaching [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] of the destruction and incineration of our ancestral idols. The general reception of this policy has not turned out as the monks would have hoped, however, as the locals are now defending themselves from both the monks and the central authority that favors them."
 tengri_events.23.a: "Ok."
 tengri_events.24.t: "Religious Pilgrimages"
 tengri_events.24.d: "It has become customary among our nobles to travel to the holy places of Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet and India to study and learn of the Buddhist faith. As they return bringing new customs and perspectives to our country our society is slowly changing. This is not always a process without problems but recently we have been seeing some very positive trends in our government as a result of this exchange."
 tengri_events.24.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.25.t: "Land Theft"
 tengri_events.25.d: "With the increasing influence of the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] faith in our country a number of new monasteries have been founded in our country. Their purpose is both to harbor the [Root.SecondaryReligion.GetName] monks that have come to our lands and the slowly growing number of native [Root.GetAdjective] monks.\nTraditional landholders don't seem to be very impressed by the pretensions of these newcomers, however, and have been helping themselves to the lands reserved for the monks. The monks claim that the land would be made more productive under their control while the land holders feel they are demanding the right to what is already theirs."
 tengri_events.25.a: "We must support these orders!"
 tengri_events.25.b: "We must protect the traditional rights of our people."
 tengri_events.26.t: "Pali Legal Traditions"
 tengri_events.26.d: "With Theravada Buddhism comes an ancient legal tradition based on old Pali scriptures as well as the collected rulings of many judges and monarchs before up to this day. Some Theravada monks have found our lack of collected written rulings very disturbing and have sought our blessings to create a collection of up-to-date rulings that, together with the Pali Canon, could serve as a basis for future rulings in our country."

 tengri_events.26.b: "The Yassa is enough for us."

 tengri_events.27.d: "By adopting the Mahayana faith we have opened our borders to a wide range of traditions and teachings but none seem to have attracted as many followers as the promises of the 'Pure Land' movement has. Throughout [Root.GetName] subjects immersed in meditation and recitation have become an increasingly common sight."

 tengri_events.30.d: "Impressed by the refined and well-argued tenets of Confucianism many of our nobles have begun to strive to improve themselves through rigorous study and hard work. As a result we are not only becoming better at understanding the wider Confucian world but the administration of our land and resources has notably improved and above all become more consistent."

 tengri_events.31.d: "As the learned ideals of Confucian philosophy gain more and more ground among the [Root.GetAdjective] nobility [Root.Monarch.GetName] has been beset by fears that our old ways are being forgotten. Many high ranking [Root.GetAdjective] dignitaries have taken to using foreign titles and names rather than the [Root.Culture.GetName] titles of our ancestors. Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] worries that in a generation none will remember the old ways of the bow and horse and our nation will be one of weak scribes and poets."
 tengri_events.31.a: "No nation that has abandoned its own language can prosper!"
 tengri_events.31.b: "We have no reason to fear the Confucian Way."
 tengri_events.32.t: "Confucian Elites Alienated"
 tengri_events.32.d: "Participation in many traditional rituals is reserved for our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and those closest to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim]. While this means the Confucian elite of our country cannot take part this has not often been a problem as they view such 'superstitious' rituals and sacrifices with at best mild displeasure. This insistence to keep our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and his closest from the old [Root.Religion.GetName] elites separate from our other subjects has, however, led to an unnecessarily sharp divide between the two groups. This, rather than the rituals themselves, seems to be a constant source of irritation and misunderstandings, even at the very top of our society."
 tengri_events.32.a: "Praise the heavens!"
 tengri_events.32.b: "Let us device common rituals instead."
 tengri_events.33.t: "[Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.33.d: "Those around [Root.Heir.GetName] agree that the child is showing promise beyond what was initially expected. [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] is learning quickly and [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] skills are improving by the day.\nTraditionally the heirs of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] should spend their young years learning how to ride and shoot as the [Root.Culture.GetName] warriors of our past. This might not be the best way to take care of the growing abilities of [Root.Heir.GetName] however. Given the opportunity Confucian teachers promise to teach our heir how to better [Root.Heir.GetHerselfHimself] and more importantly how to rule and make the most of our land and its subjects."
 tengri_events.33.a: "Let us hire Confucian teachers."
 tengri_events.33.b: "A traditional education is the only way."
 tengri_events.33.c: "We have no extra resources to spare for [Root.Heir.GetHerHim]."
 tengri_events.35.t: "Spread of the Tea Ceremony"
 tengri_events.35.d: "The elaborate Tea Ceremonies that are common in many Shinto lands have spread far further than the Shinto religion itself and are becoming commonplace in most [Root.GetAdjective] cities as well as among the members of our court."
 tengri_events.34.t: "Examination of Administrators"
 tengri_events.34.d: "The Chinese have long felt that a good way to ensure efficient administration according to Confucian ideals is to hold general examinations for all administrators. This works well for a country with generations of experience to draw upon, something we do not have.\nThe current lack of both administrators and teachers might be remedied by attracting some of those that have failed the examinations in neighboring countries but we would be paying a high price for an uncertain commodity."
 tengri_events.34.a: "It is a risk we must take."
 tengri_events.34.b: "Let us seek talent among our own instead."
 tengri_events.35.a: "Our courtly culture will never be the same."
 tengri_events.35.b: "Encourage the spread of the Way of Tea."
 tengri_events.36.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] Loses Face"
 tengri_events.36.d: "The Shinto view of failure is somewhat different from that of our Tengri traditions. As Shinto values become an increasingly important part of our society the expectations on our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] change.\nSome actions of [Root.Monarch.GetName] have come to be interpreted as lacking in both honor and ability by those who follow the syncretic mix of Shinto and Tengri customs that has come to take shape in our lands."
 tengri_events.36.a: "This is unfortunate."
 tengri_events.36.b: "The Shamans say I cannot be faulted."
 tengri_events.37.t: "Japanese Swordsmithing"
 tengri_events.37.d: "Opening up our realm to Shinto customs and culture have also resulted in an increasing migration of Shinto practitioners into our lands, among them a number of Japanese weaponsmiths. The Swords they produce have become increasingly popular with the richer parts of our society and Japanese smiths are becoming common in most of our cities. Many of our elite warriors have begun to train with these weapons.\nSome worry that this will mean the abandonment of the Martial traditions of our ancestors though even those that cling to the old ways have benefited from a greater understanding of foreign fighting techniques."
 tengri_events.37.a: "Encourage our elites to use these swords."
 tengri_events.37.b: "Bow and arrow is for the true Tengri warrior."
 tengri_events.38.t: "Growth of Monasteries"
 tengri_events.38.d: "Used to acting far away from the Patriarch of their church the Coptic Monastic Orders have quickly made themselves at home in our lands. They are now growing in numbers and influence, especially in the frontier regions under our control. Under ideal circumstances the orders stand ready to move into a newly conquered region, establishing new monasteries, quickly stabilizing and converting the region to their faith. Our Shamans are alarmed at this practice as they feel they should be the ones to welcome our new subjects rather than these foreign Monks."
 tengri_events.38.a: "Excellent!"
 tengri_events.38.b: "We must promote our Tengri Shamans!"
 tengri_events.39.t: "Papal Embassy"
 tengri_events.39.d: "An official Papal embassy has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] seeking audience with [Root.Monarch.GetName]. The task of the envoys is to judge the sincerity of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], to once again hear him accept the pope as the head of the church and to include [Root.Monarch.GetName] into the wider Catholic community.\nIn order to achieve this the envoys have brought with them a number of books, maps and learned men. Surely these men are also spies, eager to learn our secrets. It is also certain that our Shamans will disagree with any policy of bowing to a foreign head of religion and refusing them an audience would please them. But perhaps the knowledge these Catholics bring can make up for missing that opportunity."
 tengri_events.39.a: "Send these spies back home!"
 tengri_events.39.b: "We are loyal followers of the Roman Church."
 tengri_events.40.t: "Christian Missionaries"
 tengri_events.40.d: "A group of Christian missionaries from abroad has arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] and are eager to spread the word of God among the heathens. Not wanting to come into conflict with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], however, they come seeking our blessing. The leader of the group has approached the throne asking to be given the right to spread the Christian faith in a region under our control unhindered."
 tengri_events.40.a: "Let them go wherever they please."
 tengri_events.40.b: "Send them back where they came from."
 tengri_events.40.a.tt: "This province may come to change Religion in the future."
 tengri_events.40.c: "Prohibit them from converting Tengriists."
 tengri_events.41.t: "Spread of Christianity"
 tengri_events.41.d: "The missionaries in [Root.GetName] have made good progress towards converting the local population there. Shamans have become an increasingly rare sight and a number of churches dot the landscape."
 tengri_events.41.a: "Praise the Lord."
 tengri_events.42.t: "Conflicts between Shamans and Missionaries"
 tengri_events.42.d: "The presence of a mission in [Root.GetName] has led to a number of conflicts between the [Root.Religion.GetName] Shamans and the local Priests. Shamans have proclaimed curses over the priests and sometimes on entire congregations."
 tengri_events.42.a: "It is time for the missionaries to leave."
 tengri_events.42.b: "We must not interfere."
 tengri_events.43.t: "Christian Ruler Alarmed"
 tengri_events.43.d: "The adoption of Christianity beside the traditional [Root.Religion.GetName] faith of our ancestors has given rise to a number of less than orthodox customs. Syncretic rituals that reference both the god of Christianity and the gods of the sky have become commonplace and some have even been adopted at the court of [Root.Monarch.GetName].\nWhile this seems to please most of our Christian subjects the delicate sensibilities of a Christian subject ruler visiting [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have been deeply upset by his forced participation in such rituals."
 tengri_events.43.a: "But they're both lords of heaven?"
 tengri_events.43.b: "Try to make amends."
 tengri_events.44.t: "Miracle"
 tengri_events.44.d: "Word has reached us of a remarkable wanderer. Drawing his power from his strong devotion to the Christian god he has managed to heal the weak and cure the sick. An increasing number of converts have begun to create congregations in his trail. Many still incorporate parts of their old Tengri customs in their daily life but this holy man has been more successful in attracting followers than many of the more traditional missionaries that now frequent our countryside."
 tengri_events.44.a: "Let him roam freely."
 tengri_events.44.b: "Invite him to Court."
 tengri_events.45.t: "Life at Court"
 tengri_events.45.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has always taken a great interest in both our adopted religion and those that practice it. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has, however, not always led a life that many of our Christian subjects would approve of. Between the influence of Shamans at court and the habits of [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] there are many that feel we are risking divine punishment.\nPerhaps we should consider instituting some more clearly Christian rules for our court and ruler? Restricting the influence of Shamans, the number of allowed wives and generally the number of officially sanctioned rituals would go a long way towards placating the Christian communities."
 tengri_events.45.a: "A Christian court it is!"
 tengri_events.45.b: "Theses religions must coexist, side by side."
 tengri_events.45.b.tt: "Every province following our ??YSyncretic??! faith will get ??R6??! unrest for ??Y10??! years."
 tengri_events.46.t: "Brahmans and Shamans"
 tengri_events.46.d: "A battle of the minds and spirits of our people has ensued between Brahmin priests and Shamans, who consider themselves guides and protectors of our people. Lately heated discussions frequently end with Shamans cursing the Brahmins while the Brahmins turn to us, insisting that their hereditary status be respected."
 tengri_events.46.a: "Support the Brahmin Administrators."
 tengri_events.46.b: "Support our Shamans."
 tengri_events.46.c: "Avoid picking sides."
 tengri_events.47.t: "Syncretism"
 tengri_events.47.d: "The coexistence of Hinduism and the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith has been easier in many ways than we initially feared. There are already many examples of Tengri deities being incorporated among the many gods of the Hindus and of Hindu gods and customs being incorporated into the lives of the Tengri worshippers. In fact to a certain extent it seems that the same has started happening to many other religions in the far corners of our empire, with many lesser and higher gods being incorporated into the joint Hindu-Tengri Pantheon."
 tengri_events.47.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.48.t: "Spread of the Caste System"
 tengri_events.48.d: "With the elevation of the Hindu faith a great number of Hindus have come to settle in many of our cities and with them the concept of caste is spreading into our lands. Interestingly it seems at least some of those that regularly do business with the Hindus as well as some of our Shamans have taken to this way to organize society.\nThe immediate effects seem hard to judge but for now everything seems to progress a bit more smoothly in [Root.GetName]."
 tengri_events.48.a: "Ok."
 tengri_events.49.t: "A Jewish Homeland?"
 tengri_events.49.d: "Word of our adoption of the Jewish religion has started to spread far and wide among the Jews of the Diaspora. A slow but increasingly steady trickle of immigrants have begun to appear at our borders, hoping to live and serve in a state where they are not confined to Ghettos or restricted by laws and prejudice."
 tengri_events.49.a: "Let them serve as administrators!"
 tengri_events.49.b: "Let them serve as soldiers!"
 tengri_events.50.t: "Growing Zoroastrian Merchant Community"
 tengri_events.50.d: "While the Fire temples of [Root.GetName] probably seem a bit unorthodox to them our society is still attracting a number of Zoroastrians in the diaspora. Ever since they left Persia behind almost a millennium ago they have grown used to being the minority and seem content to mix with our society at large. Some, however, have come asking for an area of their own where they can live and worship in their traditional ways."
 tengri_events.50.a: "'Like sugar in milk.'"
 tengri_events.50.b: "Best to keep them all in one place."
 tengri_events.51.t: "Growing Pantheon"
 tengri_events.51.d: "Fusing our Shamanic traditions with the wide range of animist beliefs we have come across have resulted in an ever-growing Pantheon. There is not a malady, disaster or fate that hasn't got at least one deity to counteract it. This wide acceptance of differing spiritual traditions has led to an increasingly efficient handling of the religious conflicts between the subjects under our control, no matter what they believe."
 tengri_events.51.a: "Great."
 tengri_events.52.t: "Support of the Shamans"
 tengri_events.52.d: "Court Shamans have always been an important institution in our state. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] nobles participate in a wide range of ceremonies to ensure the gods looking favorable on our endeavors, be it going to war or sealing a strategic marriage. With the greatly increased numbers of Shamanic traditions we now patronize we can be sure of their support, a point not lost on our subjects."
 tengri_events.52.a: "The Gods favor our wars."
 tengri_events.52.b: "The Gods will bless our people."
 tengri_events.53.t: "Flower Wars"
 tengri_events.53.d: "Inspired by Nahuatl forerunners our warriors have begun to raid foreign lands already subjugated by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to take prisoners to be offered at the Sacrificial Stone to the heavens. This is slightly problematic as these are people who have agreed to obey us in exchange for protection but the experience these warriors get in close combat could be useful to us."
 tengri_events.53.a: "Extradite the offending warriors."
 tengri_events.53.b: "The gods crave their blood!"
 tengri_events.54.t: "Sumptuary Restrictions?"
 tengri_events.54.d: "Taking offense to the luxurious clothes of a merchant in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] a number of warriors have taken it upon themselves to storm his lavish home and rob him of his belongings. They claim such finery must be reserved for those that have distinguished themselves in battle and that they have rectified an offense to the gods. The merchant on the other hand is furious and demand retribution and for his property to be returned."
 tengri_events.54.a: "Side with the merchant."
 tengri_events.54.b: "Side with the warriors."
 tengri_events.55.t: "Confiscation of Idols"
 tengri_events.55.d: "The people of [Root.GetName] have been organizing their resistance against our rule through the local holy places and many of their leaders are to be found in the local clergy. Assimilation will surely quieten them in the long run but for now our Inti priests suggest that we confiscate their [Root.Religion.GetName] idols, by protecting them in our capital we can ensure that the people of [Root.GetName] remember where the real power lies."
 tengri_events.55.a: "An excellent idea."
 tengri_events.55.b: "Barbaric."
 tengri_events.56.t: "Ritual Ball Game"
 tengri_events.56.d: "Our Mayan priests are eager to promote the ritual ball games of their religion, a custom to which many of our warriors have been quite receptive. Many now flock to the courts to see their favorite teams compete though perhaps the associated betting is as much of an attraction as their religious conviction."
 tengri_events.56.a: "For the Gods!"
 tengri_events.56.b: "For the People!"
 tengri_events.57.t: "New Bible Translation"
 tengri_events.57.d: "Eager for all our subjects to be able to read and interpret the word of God themselves the Protestant priests of our country are seeking our support for creating a new Bible translation. They claim the new translation will bring our people together as never before and introduce them to the one god they worship."
 tengri_events.57.a: "Great!"
 tengri_events.58.t: "Predestination"
 tengri_events.58.d: "The idea that 'All events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God' is held dearly among the members of the Reformed church in our country. So much so that it has come to spread beyond to those that wouldn't be considered Christians by any definition. Whether it is due to this or not lately many of our subjects seem unusually eager to outdo themselves. Be it in areas of governance or economy."
 tengri_events.58.a: "Gold is a measure of quality."
 tengri_events.58.b: "Loyalty proves character."
 tengri_events.59.t: "Monastery Established"
 tengri_events.59.d: "Some way back a number of our most pious Orthodox monks left the areas under our control in order to create a fortified frontier monastery in the wilder parts of the lands we border. The story of their success has attracted a number of believers to join them. Their settlement is now growing and will soon be noteworthy. Perhaps now would be a good time to claim the land for ourselves so that these settlers don't forget where they came from?"
 tengri_events.59.a: "It is time we claim those lands for ourselves."
 tengri_events.59.b: "They are on their own."
 tengri_events.60.t: "Arrival of a Rich Merchant"
 tengri_events.60.d: "Eager to make a good profit of the various goods available in our lands merchants from the wider Muslim world continue to seek out our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. One such man is now claiming that we are not doing enough to capitalize on the resources under our control. For a modest fee he is offering to act as our agent in all contacts with foreign merchants in general and the influential finance groups such as the Karimis in particular."
 tengri_events.60.a: "Interesting."
 tengri_events.61.t: "Sickness of [Root.Heir.GetName]"
 tengri_events.61.d: "A strange disease has struck [Root.Heir.GetName], a fever that our Shamans have been unable to stop or even alleviate. A visiting Sunni physician claims to recognize the condition and to be able to cure it. Our Shamans would likely take offense if we brought in an outsider after their own widely known failure but the life of our heir seems to be at its end unless we do something."
 tengri_events.61.a: "Let the Physician try."
 tengri_events.61.b: "There is nothing we can do."
 tengri_events.62.t: "Protection of Pilgrims"
 tengri_events.62.d: "Our frequent wars have made the faithful Muslims of our state reluctant to undertake pilgrimages to the holy cities. While faith may frequently overcome fear it is true that pilgrims passing through our lands are often attacked and their journey is often a perilous ordeal."
 tengri_events.62.a: "We must ensure their safety."
 tengri_events.62.b: "Their faith will protect them."
 tengri_events.63.t: "Influence of the Khojas"
 tengri_events.63.d: "While [Root.Monarch.GetName] has limited the influence of the Khojas compared to some of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors they remain a powerful force in our lands and many of our subjects look up to the Khoja and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] family. This powerful faction in our country has never outright confronted us but their ever-present influence is slowly eroding our authority."
 tengri_events.63.a: "There is nothing to be done right now."
 tengri_events.63.b: "Attempt to limit the influence of the Khojas."

 desc_only_noble_officers: "Unless a man has been born to the privilege he will not be allowed access to the higher positions in our armies and we strive to maintain a corps of officers entirely made out of persons of noble birth.

 desc_repression_of_influential_dhimmi: "In order to restore the proper order of things in this area we have stopped local infidel landholders from spending lavishly on constructions to honor their deity.

 desc_elaborate_court_ceremonies: "We have decided to turn the courtly life of our country into the most elaborate formality imaginable.

 desc_church_minister: "One of the more talented ministers in our council has been recruited from the clergy. While this is far from unusual it means he can rely on their support and that local clerics in our administration are even more loyal to him, increasing our control over even the farthest corners of our realm."
 dhimmi_minister: "Dhimmi Councilor"
 desc_dhimmi_minister: "A very talented member of our council has a background among the Dhimmi. This is not exactly popular with everyone in our state but the support of his own estate is a benefit to our country."

 desc_nobility_sumptuary_restrictions: "We have implemented a series of harsh restrictions on who can and cannot buy certain luxury items. From clothes and jewels to perfume and the exact height or number of windows of a house everything should reflect the proper social standing of the owner.

 desc_held_back_commoners: "We have acted to protect the established classes against the ambition of the rising class of 'New Men' who aim to replace them in many higher positions of power within the state, from the army to the administrative apparatus or even the court rooms. The Merchant classes from which the new men originated see our actions as disloyal and ungrateful."

They feel we are to blame as we have allowed the Cossacks to grow too powerful which is inspiring the serfs to abandon their rightful masters.\nRepresentatives of the major families now demand that we limit the power of the Cossacks so that they can expand their latifundia in the regions bordering the steppe. This way, they argue, the wild fields can be tamed and the laws of the realm upheld."

Once the raids have been executed these plunderers retreat back behind the borders of [cossacks_here_target.GetName] as quickly as they came.

Several such raids have lately laid waste to the [From.GetAdjective] countryside and even major cities some way from our borders.\nAs the Cossacks responsible are based inside our borders the [From.GetAdjective] have now demanded both compensation and for the culprits to be brought to justice."

 cossack_estate_events.6.t: "Growth of Cossacks Power"
 cossack_estate_events.6.d: "While few would dispute their influence on the Steppes the Cossacks have many things working against them when it comes to gaining influence in the halls of power. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ despise them and would see them all brought to work as serfs on their latifundia and their manners have not brought them many friends in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName].\nLately, however, things have been going their way. They have managed to defend their settlements and their services to the state as raiders are indisputable."

 cossack_estate_events.7.d: "The free nature of the Cossacks and the distance between them and the halls of power in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] has always been a problem for them. Lacking hereditary privileges the number of Cossacks registered with the state as officers with the benefits that entail have been decreasing steadily."

 cossack_estate_events.8.d: "Not all Cossacks are awarded the same privileges by the state. Traditionally rights are awarded to specific Cossacks that are willing to perform great services to the state in times of war. As these rights are not transferable upon death this means that the influence of the Cossacks can vary greatly over time. According to the Cossacks it is high time we grant them further privileges to bolster our numbers."

 cossack_estate_events.8.b: "Let them tend to their Steppes."
 cossack_estate_events.9.t: "Supplies for the Cossacks"
 cossack_estate_events.9.d: "Life on the frontier can be harsh and while the Cossacks are used to fighting their own battles a little help from the central treasury could probably be put to good use. Last season was unusually harsh and together with an increasing number of Tatar incursions many Cossacks now have an urgent shortage of food for the coming months. If we were to supply the Cossacks with grain as well as military supplies such as arms and uniforms we would not only be strengthening our defenders on the Steppes directly we would likely also tie them closer to our state."
 cossack_estate_events.9.a: "Send them what they need."
 cossack_estate_events.9.b: "They'll have to make do themselves."
 cossack_estate_events.10.t: "Grain Trade Disturbances"
 cossack_estate_events.10.d: "There has always been tension between the Cossacks and the other estates, if nothing else because of their uncommon manners and diverse backgrounds. Lately, however, these have increased considerably. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are alarmed at the Cossacks raids and claim that they are targeting shipments of their grain. The Cossacks themselves claim that they are only attacking the Tartars and brigands in the area and that the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are simply mistaken. As there is little in the way of government representation in the area it is difficult to ascertain the truth but there is clearly friction between these two groups and we are expected to either reprimand or sanction one side in this conflict."

 cossack_estate_events.11.d: "The life of the Steppes has made the Cossacks used to a frontier living. Constant threats from both a harsh climate in an unsettled land and of Tartar raiders have made the Cossacks both feared warriors and hardy settlers.\nAs we turn our sights on the land of [cossack_settlers_province.GetName] it is becoming apparent that life on the eastern frontier is not that different from that of the Steppes we already control."

 cossack_estate_events.12.d: "The deep distrust of the Cossacks for the state in general and our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in particular has culminated in a total breakdown of authority on the steppes. The communities of the Cossacks are openly hostile to our emissaries and de facto now act entirely independent from central authority."

 cossack_estate_events.13.d: "Borders can often be theoretical things, especially in the wild fields. It seems the Cossacks have expanded rapidly into [growing_cossack_communities.GetName]. We could attempt to reverse this development but the Cossacks would likely not take kindly to being removed from land they have worked hard to settle."

 cossack_estate_events.14.d: "The old dream of the Cossacks has always been to be accepted as the equals to the established estates such as the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. Never has this dream been closer to realization than now. The Cossacks have achieved great influence in our state and in many ways we rely on their support.\nGiven the favorable circumstances many Cossacks are now voicing their old demands for official recognition and privileges."

 tribal_estate_events.1.t: "Tensions between Nomads and Sedentary Population"
 tribal_estate_events.1.d: "The difference between tax collection, extortion or demanding tribute can sometimes be somewhat vague. In many parts of our country taxes are collected by the Nomadic Clans in ways very similar to how they would have conducted themselves during a raid.\nToday an emissary from some of our more well-to-do subjects arrived to tell a tale of how the would-be tax collectors pillaged their lands and then laid siege to their fortified homes. They now demand retribution from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for the perpetrators to be punished. The tribes would, however, likely not take kindly to any such restrictions of their conduct."

 tribal_estate_events.2.t: "Growth of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.2.d: "A tribal state is always somewhat unstable. Some clans will quickly increase their influence over the others, only to collapse again just as suddenly. Lately a new group of tribal leaders have come to extend their power over the lesser tribes considerably."
 tribal_estate_events.2.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.3.t: "Decline of Tribal Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.3.d: "Due to infighting between clans, poorly thought out political maneuvers and conflicts relating to succession our influence over the other tribes has increased considerably during the last few years. This decline in tribal influence is unlikely to last but comes as a nice respite for now."
 tribal_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.4.t: "Local Chiefs Complain"
 tribal_estate_events.4.d: "Several Clan Chiefs have complained to us about young men from their area leaving their clans and joining our own army. They claim that this is not how it was done in the days of our father, and that every man should serve in his local clan's army first. What shall we do?"
 tribal_estate_events.4.a: "Send the young men home."
 tribal_estate_events.4.b: "Keep them in the army."
 tribal_estate_events.5.t: "Chiefs are withholding Taxes"
 tribal_estate_events.5.d: "One of our closest advisors has come to us with proof of the local Chiefs not paying much tax to us as one should expect from their lands. This is a delicate situation, but we need to come to a decision quickly."

 tribal_estate_events.6.t: "Our Horde is in disarray!"
 tribal_estate_events.6.d: "Keeping nomadic tribes together is never an easy task and right now we are living through some dire times. The $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ could very likely help us stabilize the situation so that we can get back on our feet but we would be increasing their influence over our state."

 tribal_estate_events.8.d: "Our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has proven [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself] unable to keep the [Root.GetAdjective] unified and the $ESTATE_NOMADIC_TRIBES$ worry that we are becoming the object of ridicule. Prominent clan leaders have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] offering to strengthen our rule though some would say that relying on others to enforce this unity makes for an unstable peace."

 tribal_estate_events.11.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle] after the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 tribal_estate_events.11.d: "A distant cousin of [Root.Monarch.GetName] has managed to gain the gratitude of the tribes. Many strong tribal leaders are now demanding that we change the future plans of succession to ensure that this cousin is guaranteed his rightful place as [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Whether they are motivated by true loyalty to our kinsman or feel he could easily be controlled is hard to tell but they would certainly not take refusal to follow their advice very well."

 tribal_estate_events.12.d: "Prominent Tribal leaders have approached us demanding that we let them make use of the state resources to defend their lands. They claim that neighboring states are making incursions and raids into the land they control and that the only efficient way to defend them is to put some of our troops directly under their command."
 tribal_estate_events.12.a: "Of course they shall have our men!"

As we rely on them for most military matters this will result in quite a strain on our remaining leadership."

 church_estate_events.1.d: "The $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has long been one of the foremost pillars of the [Root.GetAdjective] realm, providing not only spiritual guidance but also administrators, judges and diplomats for the benefit of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. In return for these great services no ecclesiastical manor, monastery or other estate pay any taxes to the state and the temporal authorities do not meddle in the internal affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$.\nTimes grow dire, however, and the state has to cover an increasing number of expenses.

In return for these great services many donations have been made over the years, both by the state and by others, in the form of villages to support the Brahman communities.

 church_estate_events.2.t: "Advancement of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.2.d: "The power of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has never relied on the state itself. Rather it is in many ways the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who through their ties to the spiritual realm lend their legitimacy to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. A combination of deft political maneuvering, perceived bad omens and generous donations from our subjects have lately cemented the power of this estate."
 church_estate_events.2.a: "Ok."
 church_estate_events.3.t: "$ESTATE_CHURCH$ losing Power"
 church_estate_events.3.d: "More than any other Estate the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ is dependent on their standing with the common man. It has been hard to put the finger at exactly why but over the recent years the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has come to be seen less as the spiritual guardians of our country and more as rich and corrupted intrigue-makers. Combined with some unfortunate investments in the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ properties themselves and poor political maneuvering the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been losing both power and influence."
 church_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."

The pious commoners are now withholding the tithe in a protest against a particularly bad example of misuse of the authority of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Pious $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are now objecting to paying tithes to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ as they consider the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ unfit to receive them.\nThe $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are furious and demand that we fine the obstinate $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."

 church_estate_events.5.d: "Relations between the state and the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has now sunk low enough that it is entirely characterized by distrust and even open defiance. The Holy Places of our nation are centers of resistance to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and most of the faithful in our lands are doubting the legitimacy of our rule.\nWith things as they are it comes as no surprise that all it took for the situation to ignite was one small misstep by our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] during a religious ceremony last week. The peasants are now rising all over our country with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ inciting them and directing their anger towards us."
 church_estate_events.5.a: "Ok."
 church_estate_events.6.t: "Triumph of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$?"
 church_estate_events.6.d: "While none would openly defy the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ there are few states where they are as influential as in [Root.GetName]. There isn't a single institution in our country that isn't entirely under the influence of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the power of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] depends on them now more than ever.\nIt is perhaps only natural that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ now also wishes to take a more active role in the practical ruling of our country. Lately a number of suggestions have been made by their representatives to further harmonize our laws and traditions with those of the spiritual realm. The ambition is to cleanse our court culture from any unorthodoxy and to ensure that the country is governed according to religiously sound rules and ideals."

 church_estate_events.6.b: "Reject their authority."
 church_estate_events.7.t: "Strong $ESTATE_CHURCH$"
 church_estate_events.7.d: "While many rulers can rely on the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ few have as strong supporters as we do. A long tradition of close cooperation and loyalty between us and $ESTATE_CHURCH$ has resulted in a situation where the Church thinks of itself as a part of the state administration rather than an independent actor. Throughout our state the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are spreading the word of the excellence and spiritual strength of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 church_estate_events.8.t: "Land Theft"
 church_estate_events.8.d: "Many land donations are quite old and while they are always written down both landscape and names may well have changed since a donation was originally written. Recently the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ have been accusing several members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of outright land theft in the form of encroaching on lands donated to the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ long ago. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that it is the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ who are trying to seize land areas they do not own.\nWhoever we decide to side with will become the majority land holder in the area."

 church_estate_events.9.d: "There has always been some discrepancy between the religion actually taught and defended by the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the actual faith of the people in the provinces. Most of the time the differences are small enough that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ chooses to ignore them to instead focus on reinforce the more orthodox spiritual ideas of the people.\nIt seems, however, that certain ideas that are quite unorthodox, if rooted in old traditions, have begun to spread together with the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith among our non-[Root.Religion.GetName] subjects. The resulting mix of old heathen ideas, popular superstitions and the actual [Root.Religion.GetName] itself has been quite too much for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to stomach even if it seems to have made conversion a much more attractive proposition for our heathen subjects."
 church_estate_events.9.a: "Attempt to root out this syncretism."
 church_estate_events.9.b: "Better let this run its course."

 church_estate_events.10.d: "The time has come for the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ to appoint a new leader to assist our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in the capital. The likely candidate is an old cleric with a solid history as a prominent member of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ behind him. He has, however, also acquired many enemies during his life who now hope to see a somewhat younger candidate with a less ugly past be appointed. As [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] it would not be hard to influence this election to the younger candidate who would likely be more loyal. To be seen to meddle in the affairs of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$, however, would very likely weaken the faction in the long run."

 nobles_estate_events.1.t: "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.d: "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"

 nobles_estate_events.3.d: "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NOBLES$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."

As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."

In some cases the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NOBLES$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear.

Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ would likely resent it."

The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors.

Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."

 nobles_estate_events.10.d: "As the state and its bureaucracy grow there is an ever-growing need of people to oversee and administrate various lands and functions. The [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] have traditionally been more associated with military services to the state but have increasingly made it clear that they still expect to be first in line when government offices are being handed out. The [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] on the other hand claim that the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] considers such appointments as mere rewards and will use them only to enrich themselves. Instead the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] argue we should appoint men out of individual merit.\nThe unexpected death of a trusted secretary has left a vacant position to be filled at the center of this conflict, with the [Root.GetBurghersOrFallbackName] supporting one candidate and the [Root.GetNobilityOrFallbackName] expecting us to pick another. While both candidates are talented men this has to be a political decision."

 nobles_estate_events.11.d: "The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have a long tradition of service to the state both as military leaders or more recently as dependable administrators. In a state where the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ are as strongly entrenched and loyal as ours this means that from time to time nobles of great talent and loyalty will emerge to lead the country to greatness."

 burghers_estate_events.1.t: "Advancement of the Merchant Classes"
 burghers_estate_events.1.d: "The status of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ does not rest on the same old traditions as that of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ or the $ESTATE_CHURCH$. Instead they have had to make their own fortunes by working diligently and then risking the profit to again expand their businesses. As a rule, however, this has gone very well for them lately. While not as prestigious business is in many ways the backbone of our economy and through their control of the coins the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have managed to increase their power over our country."
 burghers_estate_events.1.a: "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.2.t: "Robber Barons"
 burghers_estate_events.2.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are concerned with the great influence of the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ in our state. They claim that many lower members of the nobility are disregarding the peace and law of the land, using their position of power and the lands they hold to take up unreasonable tolls and taxes for traders passing by. Some are even said to attack and waylay merchants, robbing or extorting them of their money.\nRepresentatives of the [Root.GetAdjective] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now claim that the economic development of our country is held back by these excesses. The $ESTATE_NOBLES$ on the other hand argue that they are simply charging reasonably for the use of their roads property. Some are willing to give the state a part of the share they take."
 burghers_estate_events.2.a: "They only take what is their right."
 burghers_estate_events.2.b: "We must curb such excesses!"
 burghers_estate_events.3.t: "Decline of the Merchant Classes"
 burghers_estate_events.3.d: "Without the old privileges and pedigrees of other factions the status and influence of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is rarely quite as secure as that of those born into power. Lately a combination of financial misfortune and misdirected political ambitions have resulted in a loss of power and influence for the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of [Root.GetName]."
 burghers_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."
 burghers_estate_events.4.t: "[growing_city.GetCapitalName] Requests Privileges"
 burghers_estate_events.4.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of [growing_city.GetCapitalName], an increasingly important trading city, have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] today asking to be granted privileges to be able to make the region thrive without the hindrance of many of our normal taxes. Should we provide them with these means to grow they assure us that the economy of the area would quickly improve, resulting in more wealth for the state."
 burghers_estate_events.4.a: "Accept the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.4.b: "Reject the Petition."
 burghers_estate_events.5.t: "Immoral Prices"
 burghers_estate_events.5.d: "Grain prices are notoriously unstable, anything from the weather where it is grown to incidents hurting its distribution can suddenly cause the price to rise significantly. As a result of one such sudden change there is currently an acute shortage of grain in many of our larger cities. Desperate to feed themselves the common people are directing their anger at the merchants who they feel are making good use of this situation to overcharge for their wares. The merchants themselves on the other hand claim that this is a natural result of the shortage and that there simply isn't enough bread to go around."
 burghers_estate_events.5.a: "Force the Merchants to lower their prices."
 burghers_estate_events.5.b: "We should not meddle in these things."
 burghers_estate_events.5.c: "We must pay for and distribute what bread there is."
 burghers_estate_events.6.t: "Parallel Authority"
 burghers_estate_events.6.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are not the sole authority within their cities, the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ also have a strong presence in most big cities going back to their initial founding. Conflicts sometimes arise when the councils of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ implement rules that the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ disapprove of.\nSuch conflicts have become more and more commonplace and members of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ are openly acting in defiance of the various rules the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ have agreed upon in their cities. Delegates from various cities dominated by the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are now urging us to clarify the situation."
 burghers_estate_events.6.a: "Side with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 burghers_estate_events.6.b: "Side with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$."
 burghers_estate_events.7.t: "Extended Privileges for the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.7.d: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ feel that they are unduly taxed and regulated when taking in mind the great importance of their work for our country. Tolls, taxes and various tariffs are holding them back from being able to accomplish even greater things and they will not hesitate to use all of their influence to abolish them."
 burghers_estate_events.7.a: "Let us remove these obstacles!"
 burghers_estate_events.7.b: "The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ need to know their place!"
 burghers_estate_events.8.t: "Hurtful Trade Policies"
 burghers_estate_events.8.d: "The interests of prominent merchant households are being hurt by our repressive trade policies towards other countries. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ support these families and have now petitioned us to compensate them by at least opening up some other restrictions on trade to compensate for their loss of income."
 burghers_estate_events.8.a: "We must support the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$."
 burghers_estate_events.8.b: "We cannot let our trade policy be decided by these peddlers."
 burghers_estate_events.9.t: "Cottage Industry"
 burghers_estate_events.9.d: "Economic development is not always without conflict. It seems rich merchants in some of our $ESTATE_BURGHERS$-dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to the homes of families living outside the city. The fact that this 'Putting-out System' has been a very profitable strategy only further enflames the anger of the artisans in the city, who feel their ancient rights have been trampled and that the carefully managed prices of their products will suffer. The [Root.GetAdjective] artisans now turn to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to defend their privileges as the city council has been unable to root out competition from outside the city."
 burghers_estate_events.9.a: "We cannot stand in the way of progress."
 burghers_estate_events.9.b: "We must safeguard the guild privileges."
 burghers_estate_events.10.t: "Social Mobility"
 burghers_estate_events.10.d: "The growing power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has led to individuals from within their ranks to seek their fortunes in areas traditionally dominated by other groups. The sons of mid to low prominence families of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ now have the education and the ambition to match the more privileged classes and as a result an increasing number of them are now being employed as administrators, lawyers, officers as well as in other positions traditionally dominated by another estate. The $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ still feel they are being unduly held back by the archaic rights and privileges of another era but their adversaries are growing very weary of the current 'unnatural' social mobility.\nUnless we do something we risk losing the support of the privileged classes but if we withdraw our support of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ at this point this will likely have grave effects on our relations with them."
 burghers_estate_events.10.a: "We must not stand in the way of these new men."
 burghers_estate_events.10.b: "We must protect the ancient rights of the other Estates."
 burghers_estate_events.11.t: "Growth of the Economy"
 burghers_estate_events.11.d: "Our policy of cooperation with the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has come to bear fruit in the form of economic development in many fields. The cities of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ are prospering and our influence in international trade is growing rapidly."
 burghers_estate_events.11.a: "Great."
 burghers_estate_events.12.t: "The risks of Trade"
 burghers_estate_events.12.d: "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on water. Normally the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can cope with a certain amount of mishaps and have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo. Lately, however, things have been going badly for a large number of Merchant families and some are at risk of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."
 burghers_estate_events.12.a: "Compensate the Traders."
 burghers_estate_events.12.b: "They knew what they were getting into."
 burghers_estate_events.13.t: "Urbanization"
 burghers_estate_events.13.d: "While only a small portion of our population live in the cities the growing prosperity of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ is attracting an increasing number of people from the countryside. Some cities are growing so quickly that existing problems in terms of sanitation and overcrowding have gone from troubling to catastrophic according to the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$. The poor have taken up residence outside the city walls where filthy suburbs have sprung up and disease thrives.\nThe $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ find the situation intolerable and are now requesting that the state step in to provide help both in terms of resources and enforcement of rules outside of the walls. Only this way can this increasing urbanization actually lead to something good."
 burghers_estate_events.13.a: "Attempt to improve conditions."
 burghers_estate_events.13.b: "This is nothing unusual, the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ can handle it."
 burghers_estate_events.14.t: "Economic Policy"
 burghers_estate_events.14.d: "As the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ grow in power their calls for fewer trade regulations and taxes become more and more frequent. Many feel our country has an old-fashioned and repressive trade policy and that we would benefit from reducing the amount of taxes and tolls that hinder commerce."
 burghers_estate_events.14.a: "Reduce Mercantilism."
 burghers_estate_events.14.b: "Refuse to change the Trade Policy."
 burghers_estate_events.15.t: "Protests among the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.15.d: "The continuously deteriorating relationship between the state and the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ has reached the point where there is little trust at all for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in our major cities. Every state initiative is suspected at being aimed to contain the power of the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ and tax evasion has become widespread.\nIt has now come to the point that a number of guilds have begun a general strike, demanding greater autonomy and freedom from the overbearing state."
 burghers_estate_events.15.a: "They must be joking!"
 burghers_estate_events.15.b: "Give in to their demands."
 burghers_estate_events.16.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] $ESTATE_BURGHERS$"
 burghers_estate_events.16.d: "Appalled at the loss of their privileges the $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ of the [Root.GetName] province have taken up arms against us!"
 burghers_estate_events.16.a: "Ok."

We need to make arrangements with the current breed of $ESTATE_BURGHERS$ leaders in order to be sure of their loyalty."
 burghers_estate_events.17.a: "Ok."
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.t: "Overzealous Qadi"
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.d: "The Qadi in one of our major cities has been using his influence to interpret Islamic law as well as the edicts of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] a bit too zealously. Not content to keep the status quo in the largely non-Muslim city he has been trying to actively force the non-believers to convert while systematically closing down their centers of worship.\nAfter a recent suicide by a force-converted trader non-Muslims are now leaving the city en masse to settle somewhere more welcoming. While even the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ largely seem to find these actions too extreme they would likely consider any action taken against the Qadi to be much worse."
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.a: "Stand by the Qadi."
 dhimmi_estate_events.1.b: "Replace the Qadi and try to make amends."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.t: "Demands to lessen Taxes on Heathens"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.d: "As our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was on his way to the weekly procession to the royal Mosque a large number of $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ had assembled in front of the building, preventing the passage of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and demanding that some of the discriminatory taxes against non-Muslims such as the temple or pilgrimage taxes be revoked."
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.a: "Trample the dissenters!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.2.b: "Revoke some of the Taxes!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.t: "Religious Pragmatism"
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.d: "While not everyone may like it the non-Muslims in our realm have been growing in influence over the last few years. Members of the Dhimmi are frequently seen even among the more important Trade Guilds of our country and many serve as administrators in our provinces or have been allowed to keep their hereditary titles."
 dhimmi_estate_events.3.a: "Ok."
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.t: "Marginalization of the Dhimmi"
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.d: "While they make up an important part of our society the non-Muslims have lately been losing ground to other groups. They are regularly looked over for any type of government service, have to pay a number of discriminatory taxes and often see business deals going to their Muslim competitors."
 dhimmi_estate_events.4.a: "Ok."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.t: "The $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.d: "Many among the Muslim $ESTATE_NOBLES$ have been voicing complaints at what they feel is an unjust and unfair favoring of infidels in our government. Having sought the support of the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ they now claim that we are running our country contrary to established Islamic customs and that we must ensure that the infidel are kept out of positions of influence.\nThe construction of a new shrine in a province largely dominated by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ entirely funded by local nobles and merchants has escalated the situation further with the $ESTATE_CHURCH$ and the $ESTATE_NOBLES$ demanding that we tear down the holy building and put the infidels in their place."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.a: "We must listen to the $ESTATE_NOBLES$."
 dhimmi_estate_events.5.b: "Stand by the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$."
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.t: "Administrators from the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.d: "Traditionally the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ are excluded from service in many of the higher positions in the administration. Instead these are generally given to faithful Muslim literati. As our government apparatus grows, however, it has a constant thirst for more learned men and among the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ there are many that would fit this description. While some would consider it unorthodox we could probably greatly benefit from recruiting from their numbers."
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.a: "Let's put these learned men to good use."
 dhimmi_estate_events.6.b: "We cannot risk their assimilative capabilities."
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.t: "Infidel Brigands"
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.d: "The quickly deteriorating relations between the state and the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ have resulted in local relations breaking down entirely in some areas. Tax collectors tell tales of convoys vanishing on the route between areas dominated by the Dhimmi, together with what had been collected. In the cities the priests and leaders of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ agitate against us and it has become increasingly hard to keep track of our subjects even within the walls. Even those opposed to $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ influence now find that they question our ability to rule."
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.a: "Untrustworthy Infidels!"
 dhimmi_estate_events.7.b: "Make concessions to alleviate the situation."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.t: "Riches of the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$"
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.d: "Throughout the Islamic world the term $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ has come to be applied to a wide and disparate variety of people. The traditional and more restrictive definition of only Christians and Jews has quickly been abandoned by Muslim states where the majority populations are Hindus or Buddhists. Regardless of who are included the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ receive protection in exchange for being exempt from many of the laws of the realm.\nWhile this may seem unfortunate for them it is quite fortunate for us right now, while the general economy is currently still recovering from recent wars many families of the Dhimmi still hold quite large cash reserves and they have no laws or rules forbidding them from investing or lending it to others."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.a: "Convince the $ESTATE_DHIMMI$ to invest in economic recovery."
 dhimmi_estate_events.8.b: "We must not make ourselves dependent on infidels."
 dhimmi_estate_events.9.t: "Revolt of the [Root.GetName] Dhimmi"
 dhimmi_estate_events.9.d: "Desperate to have their privileges redacted the Dhimmi of [Root.GetName] have taken up arms against us!"

The future legitimacy of the Castilian throne is being questioned by some leading nobles who would prefer a relative of the King aligned with the Aragonese Crown. Meanwhile, the supporters of the current establishment are making overtures to the Portuguese crown in order to secure the position of their candidate.\nThings have now spiraled into open conflict and it seems increasingly likely that the faction without royal support will attempt to put their candidate directly on the throne rather than in queue for it. Some parts of the nobility remain undecided yet, and some have chosen to make use of this opportunity to protest against perceived infringement of their old rights in general."

 rajput_musketeerDESCR: "As the development of firearms progressed the equipment of Indian musketmen increased in quality. Precision and long range was given priority as the Mughals would continue to use musketeers as sharpshooters or marksmen. The Mughals would also continue the use of musketeers in the direct service of the central authority (as opposed to the cavalry arm in the hands of the Mansabdars)."
 reformed_mughal_mansabdarDESCR: "The Sikhs of the Punjab would develop a special kind of cavalry fighting style inspired by the Persian and Afghan armies. This was referred to as 'dhai-phat' or 'two-and-a-half' strikes. A group of cavalry would ride up to the enemy and fire their matchlocks, retreat and repeat. When the enemy was sufficiently softened the great mass of the cavalry charged with their sabers. Similarly many north Indian states increasingly came to incorporate mobile musket-armed cavalry troopers in their armies, often recruited from the many Afghan tribesmen in the region."
 indian_shock_cavalryDESCR: "The Western Deccan, an area of hills, jungles and many forts proved quite hard to subdue for the large and heavily equipped Mughal armies. In its desperate fight to survive the Ahmednagar sultanate pioneered the use of light cavalry to harass the Mughal forces. The Maratha horsemen employed by Ahmednagar were so successful that they were soon employed by other rulers as well."
 bhonsle_infantryDESCR: "Many tribesmen of the Kanara, Desh and Malnad regions, such as the Berads and Mavales, adopted matchlock muskets for hunting and warfare early on. Due to their familiarity with the weapons these tribesmen soon became the primary musketmen in southern India. The Maratha armies in particular came to rely on these tribal groups for recruiting infantry to their armies. The tribal organization of the troops was often kept, with the headmen serving as officers. Berads and Mavales would increasingly be deployed in Maratha, Mughal and Mysorean armies during the 17th and 18th centuries and would eventually form the core of future European-style infantry regiments in the area."
 indian_archersDESCR: "While Elephants were a common element in most Indian armies they would often only be used in smaller numbers by commanders and as a supplement to the cavalry or infantry. In the regions dominated by jungle however, such as Orissa or Bastar, horses are both hard to use effectively and to keep in good health. As a result armies in these regions would rely much more on larger units of elephants used as mobile archer platforms."
 indian_arquebusierDESCR: "With the general lack of interest in the development of infantry tactics in Indian armies the advent of fire arms would at first not make a big impact. While common in Indian armies they would not make up a sizable part of the infantry troops for a long time and firearms would continue to be used in an individual way rather than adopted for specific formations. Rather than equipping their own units with the new weapons the Indian states would initially be content to hire foreign, often Turkoman, arquebusiers as a supplement to their archers and artillery."
 rajput_hill_fightersDESCR: "With the arrival of Muslim powers came an increased influx of good foreign cavalry mounts to India. The use of Muslim military tactics eventually became commonplace even in the armies of Hindu states such as the Vijayanagara Empire. In the north-west the Rajput warriors quickly adapted to the tactics of the Indian sultanates and a new breed of Rajput cavalry horses also soon emerged. The care and breeding of these Marwari horses would take on a highly ceremonial and revered role in the highly militant Rajput societies. In the southern Indian climate breeding cavalry mounts proved harder and south Indian rulers found themselves having to rely on the traders of the Indian Ocean to supply their cavalry."
 mughal_mansabdarDESCR: "Throughout the 15th century cavalry continued to be the most influential of the combat arms in India. The arrival of Babur in the early 16th century and the birth of the Mughal Empire came to further accentuate this trend. Babur made use of large contingents of cavalry archers from the steppes of Transoxiana during his invasion and the Mughals who came after him would continue to rely on a large cavalry arm. As the other states in northern India tried to catch up with the Mughal military machine many of them came to rely increasingly on the use of Central Asian adventurers as cavalry officers. One of these Afghan adventurers would come to found the short-lived Suri Empire in eastern and central India."
 tipu_sultan_rocketDESCR: "As the 18th century progressed Indian infantry came to fight more coordinated, with a higher rate of fire and be put to much better use than before. The addition of military innovations such as Mysorean rockets and the integration of Indian light cavalry allowed Indian states to be much more successful against European armies. Striking a good balance at this, Mysore in particular would, under Haider Ali and Tipu Sultan, come to propel itself from a local kingdom to a regional South Indian power."
 indian_footsoldierDESCR: "In Indian military history the infantry was often cheap to come by and easy to replace due to the large Indian population. Cavalry on the other hand was expensive and had often, at least since the arrival of the Muslim armies in the 13th century, proved to be the decisive element on Indian battlefields. Perhaps because of this the development of infantry tactics would not receive as much attention during most of the early modern era. The role of the infantry was to make up the bulk of a force and to siege the many forts of the Indian subcontinent."
 indian_elephantDESCR: "As the Mughal empire grew the need for a central organization to keep track of its many power holders became a necessity. Under Akbar a numerical ranking system for all nobles (Mansabdars) was implemented. Jagirs, allowances and the number of cavalry troopers a noble was obliged to field, would become dependent on this rank."
 mughal_musketeerDESCR: "With Babur's invasion of India the subcontinent saw its first organized use of fire arms. Unlike in the west, however, the musketmen, or Toofangchis, as used by Babur would serve as marksmen in his armies, firing individually at specific targets both during pitched battles and sieges. Babur took care to train these troops to achieve better results and unlike the Mughal cavalry arm the recruitment, training and organization of musketmen would be kept under his direct control. Whether Babur's great success at Panipat was due to the use of fire arms or not the use of musketmen became increasingly commonplace in Indian armies after Babur's invasion."
 maharathan_cavalryDESCR: "After the fall of the Ahmednagar sultanate the Marathas that had previously thrived in its service came to fight in the service of Bijapur and other local or regional powers eager to develop further ways to outsmart the large Mughal armies encroaching on the Deccan. With the rise of Maratha military ability came the rise of Maratha political power and these Deccani warriors would soon form states of their own, overshadowing their former Muslim employers and proving to be a threat to their Mughal nemesis. Through the use of light cavalry and infantry the Marathan armies would be able to harass and cut off much larger and less mobile Mughal forces and carve out a number of empires from the declining Mughal state."
 sikh_rifleDESCR: "Hiring of European officers to train and lead Indian regiments changed the military landscape of India in many ways. Armies using traditional tactics, emphasizing cavalry, were often beaten by forces with drilled musket-armed infantry and mobile artillery. In order to stay ahead it would become essential to organize cavalry, infantry and artillery to fight together to a much greater degree than had previously been seen in India. Mysore under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan was one of the states that took this lesson to heart the most and managed to prove that as long as they could be properly coordinated with the other arms light cavalry was still a very powerful tool for disrupting the operations of their opponents in India."
 south_indian_musketeerDESCR: "Vijayanagara and its successor states relied on the local chiefs of the communities of their empire for much of its administration. Among their tasks was the organization of local defense and the recruitment and marshaling of troops."
 sikh_hit_and_runDESCR: "The less prestigious infantry arm would commonly attract third or fourth sons of poor Purbia Rajput families in the northern countryside, deserted Afghan clansmen, Jat farmers, and other groups with poor prospects. Unable to afford horses these groups would adopt the use of firearms as a cheaper way to succeed in the battlefield. While they were given little formal training these self-educated Purbia musketmen would eventually make up the core of a more modern northern Indian army as their use of firearms and eventual use of more modern European infantry tactics allowed them to increasingly make a difference on the battlefields of India."
 indian_rifleDESCR: "The role that the Telingas and Berads filled in the south would eventually be filled by the Purbias in the north. British officers in the service of the East India Company and French adventurers in the service of the Mughals or other Indian rulers became increasingly common as commanders of Indian musket infantry in the north-east. As a result drilled Indian infantry regiments could soon be found in all the armies of the states in the north as well as in mercenary bands. Eventually recruitment would become even more organized and these northern Indian troops, known as Sepoys after the Mughal term for an infantryman would become closely associated with Company rule in India."
 reformed_mughal_musketeerDESCR: "As the Vijayanagara empire fractured into a number of Nayak kingdoms following its defeat at Talicota the local Poligars remained in place as local power holders responsible for recruitment. In some of these successor states the Poligars would acquire an even more independent position than they had under Vijayanagara. Along with the continued shortage of horses this led to an even bigger infantry ratio in the southern armies. Firearms also continued to become more common in the south as well as in the north during the 16th century."
 bhonsle_cavalryDESCR: "The light Maratha cavalry increasingly proved how vulnerable the grand Mughal heavy cavalry armies were if you could cut off their supplies. During the first half of the 18th century as Maratha power grew and as infantry increasingly became organized in the European fashion there came a need for more organized cavalry regiments. From the 1720s and onwards the size and level of organization of Indian cavalry armies would increase to attempt to match the development of infantry and artillery tactics that now took place. It would take some time before seasoned Indian generals would realize just how vulnerable their focus on the cavalry arm could make them against the drilled European-style musket regiments that became increasingly common during the 1700s."
 maharathan_guerilla_warfareDESCR: "As the French became increasingly entangled in the affairs of the south and eastern Indian states they started the practice of training Indian troops to use coordinated European infantry tactics. This would soon prove to be the start of a revolution in Indian warfare as infantry rather than cavalry increasingly came to be the determining factor in battles. Under Dupleix and de Bussy Telegu soldiers started to fight and arm themselves in a manner more similar to the European armies of the time. These troops were known as Telingas after their area of origin (Telingana) but soon the term came to be used about musket armed and uniformed infantry troops in other parts of India."

A proposal has been put forward for a ban on all private trading with Indians, including the death penalty for anyone caught teaching an Indian how to fire a gun. This new law will injure the local economy of both the Indians and the local population but will ensure our security from armed Indian raids."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA300: "Approve the law"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB300: "Ignore the issue"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME301: "The Harvest of [GetYear]"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC301: "The crop harvest in [Root.GetName] has been very poor this year and the shortage of food is already felt across the colony. The prices are soaring and some predict a harsh winter might be coming. The nearby Indians have found out about our difficult situation and have volunteered some of their food supplies. What they brought isn't nearly enough to sustain us through the winter, but there must be more corn where the gift came from. Some propose that we send soldiers to the Indian villages and seize their food."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA301: "Take what we need"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB301: "We will solve this ourselves"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME302: "Wage Laws for Builders"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC302: "The prices of construction are going up because skilled labor is in shortage as new colonists flowing into the colony greatly demand their services. A proposal has been put forth that a maximum wage should be set across [Root.GetName] for all carpenters, sawyers, masons and bricklayers. The price will be set at fair levels, and everyone demanding higher payment or offering to pay more for construction work would be subject to a penalty. How do we vote?"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA302: "Vote yes, it's a sound idea"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB302: "We don't need to regulate that"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME303: "Iron Discovered"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC303: "To sustain ourselves, [Root.Owner.GetName] must seek new sources of revenue and reduce our dependence on imports. A great opportunity has presented itself though, as bog iron ore has been discovered in [Root.GetName]! The proposition is to mandate the owner to construct a furnace and a forge and immediately begin production. In exchange the owner will be guaranteed a 10-year-long tax break to subsidize the initial cost."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA303: "Sounds like a good opportunity"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB303: "No, thanks"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME304: "Domestic Wool Industry"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC304: "The dwindling profits of the colonial trade and our reliance on imported goods are starting to hurt [Root.Owner.GetName]. We must seek economic independence from imports and for that end a new proposal has been presented. By outlawing exports of sheep and ordering more wool to be produced locally we'll ensure enough warm clothes are being offered to the colonists. For this a Textile Manufactory should be started in [Root.GetName]."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA304: "Sounds like a good opportunity"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB304: "No, thanks"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME305: "A Wharf Needed"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC305: "If [Root.Owner.GetName] wants to become less dependent on [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName] and move towards self-sufficiency, we need to be able to secure enough salt and naval supplies. A prominent citizen living in [Root.GetCapitalName] has assured us that with a little help he could construct a new Wharf in [Root.GetName]. In exchange for his investment he asks for 10 years of subsidies."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA305: "Sounds like a good opportunity"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB305: "No, thanks"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME306: "Cash Crop Ban"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC306: "Unlike the founders of [Root.Owner.GetName], new settlers tend to be short-sighted and put profits ahead of securing the future existence of themselves and their families. They ignore the necessity to produce food for the colony and go straight for cash crop believing that they will be able to sell it and purchase food from other farmers. If this continues, our colony will eventually face famine and disorder. To prevent this, a law enforcing that new farmers produce food in at least a part of their fields has been suggested."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA306: "A law seems necessary"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB306: "It's none of our business"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME307: "Banned Tobacco Planting"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC307: "When we first arrived here the prices of Tobacco were soaring, and the profits were immense. Now, as more farmers arrive and start their own plantations, the supply of Tobacco has quickly risen and caused the prices in Europe to drop year after year. A proposal has been made by established planters to ban the planting of Tobacco for one year, so prices have time to recover. New farmers are obviously opposing this proposal but we must do what we must do to protect our livelihoods."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA307: "Enforce it"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB307: "Reject their proposal"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME310: "Colonial Border Conflict"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC310: "Settlers from another of [Root.Owner.ColonialParent.GetName]'s colonies have breached our borders! In search of resources they have expanded into land part of [Root.GetName] and gotten into conflict with the local population. This cannot be tolerated!"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA310: "Send the local militia to drive them out!"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB310: "Let the situation resolve itself"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC311: "In search of new land and resources, settlers from [Root.GetName] have ventured across the border into [From.GetName] which has caused conflicts with the local population there. [From.Owner.GetName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but their militia seems to have gone too far and their mission degenerated into a vengeful raid into [Root.GetName]. This cannot be tolerated!"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA311: "Send in our local militia as well!"
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTB311: "Let the situation resolve itself"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC312: "Sending our militia to drive out the competing settlers from [From.From.GetName] might have been a mistake. Encouraged by their easy success, our troops got carried away and continued into [From.GetName], raiding the border villages there. This has greatly upset [From.Owner.GetName] and they in turn sent their militia into [From.From.GetName]..."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA312: "Damn them!"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC313: "Sigh... where to begin? It seems that settlers from [From.Owner.GetName] has ventured into [From.From.GetName] - a province of [From.From.Owner.GetName] - in search of new land and resources. [From.From.Owner.GetName] then sent their militia to drive them out, but they got overzealous and pursued the settlers back into [From.GetName], raiding and burning.

 institution_events.7.a: "This changes everything..."
 institution_events.700.d: "The last century has seen Rationalism and Empiricism gaining an ever increasing popularity among the great minds of the age. In letters, publications or coffee houses kings, scientists, philosophers and litterateurs are discussing the merits of tolerance, the scientific method and the spreading of enlightenment ideals to all humanity. From universities or courts of enlightened monarchs expeditions are being sent to measure, catalogue, weigh and map the world so that we can better understand the laws that govern the things around us. Others discuss the laws that govern society and try to reach an understanding of the Rights of Man. In [From.Capital.GetCapitalName], a colossal undertaking has begun in the assembly of a complete encyclopedia of all knowledge. The Light of Reason has now been lit and many will not rest until it has been brought to all corners of the earth."
 institution_events.701.d: "Strange expeditions of men in powdered wigs have begun to appear at our borders. These travelers seem more interested in our plants, animals and even subjects than they are in our actual [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], our traders or our riches. Our informers tell us these people consider themselves the carriers of an 'Enlightenment', surely a ludicrous statement..."
 institution_events.8.t: "Challenging the Warrior Elites"
 institution_events.8.d: "Over time we have managed to strengthen the authority of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] over the provinces. This does mean that the authority of local strongmen and petty chiefs is now threatened. Normally such local forces can be handled with ease, but in [feudalism_province.GetName] the use of more direct force may be necessary to remind others of our right to rule."
 institution_events.8.a: "Crush them!"
 institution_events.8.b: "We need their support."
 institution_events.9.t: "Growing Influence of the Urban Elites"
 institution_events.9.d: "While they lack a formal voice in our government, the richer cities have many other ways to make their influence known. In some cases, cities can even band together to further increase their power over a province. The leaders of one such conglomeration in [urban_province.GetName] have recently approached us asking to formalize some of the ways in which they exert control. Allying with the cities would allow us to promote much more durable systems of government but we would likely lose the support of some of the local warrior groups we now rely on for military support."
 institution_events.9.a: "Excellent."
 institution_events.9.b: "Out of the question."
 institution_events.10.t: "Lack of Bureaucracy"
 institution_events.10.d: "Sometimes progress will be greater farther from the center of power where old elites are too entrenched to desire change. As new modes of government are becoming more commonplace in our country, locals in [feudalism_province.GetName] are getting increasingly irritated at the elites in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] who refuse to formalize any form of government institutions."
 institution_events.10.a: "We cannot hurry change."
 institution_events.10.b: "Times are changing."
 institution_events.11.t: "Informal Power Waning"
 institution_events.11.d: "Through good policies and simple repetition, authority and power can become entrenched enough to promote the growth of permanent government institutions. Over time our government practices have progressed from arbitrary demonstrations of power towards consistency."
 institution_events.11.a: "Great!"
 institution_events.12.t: "Mirrors for Princes"
 institution_events.12.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] has come to take a great interest in the Renaissance, not only for the cultural and artistic merit but also the political and scientific breakthroughs being made in the Italian states. [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] seems oblivious to such things, however, which worries our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. For generations now European princes have been able to further their education through the use of books on how to conduct yourself as a ruler. Renaissance thinkers have been quick to usurp this genre and a number of these 'Mirrors for Princes' now practically reek of the new ideas. We should consider making these books central to the education of [Root.Heir.GetName]."

 institution_events.12.b: "Let us foster a wise Princess."
 institution_events.12.c: "A local tutor will do fine."
 institution_events.20.t: "Colonial Charter?"
 institution_events.20.da: "Our colonial governor has written to us imploring us to secure further investors for the growth of our future overseas empire. There are certainly interested parties in the [institution_province.GetCapitalName] financial sector who would be interested but given the high risk they would be expecting to be granted some far-going privileges. They also expect the crown to contribute with a substantial part of the needed funds."
 institution_events.20.db: "Our conquests overseas have stimulated the growth of the financial sector in [institution_province.GetCapitalName]. From all over our home continent, investors are bringing funds to invest in an overseas colonial empire. Such speculation can be dangerous, however, and many feel we should regulate the colonial economy more clearly. By formalizing the colonial sector, we can bring order to our economy and concentrate on bringing civilization to these backward peoples."
 institution_events.20.a: "Onwards to glory!"
 institution_events.20.b: "We must bide our time."
 institution_events.21.t: "Diffusion of New World Crops"
 institution_events.21.da: "With the discovery and colonization of the New World a number of new crops have been introduced in the European economy. Potato, corn and tomatoes have slowly begun to spread among the farmers of Europe, but old habits die hard and so far these new high yield crops have been spreading very slowly.\n\nWe could attempt to stimulate this process using the state coffers, but those who currently dominate the agricultural markets would likely feel threatened."
 institution_events.21.db: "European merchants are an increasingly common sight in the great ports of Asia and their goods have in time come to penetrate even the more distant markets in our country. Among the many new products trickling into our markets are the new crops of the Americas"

 institution_events.21.a: "Certainly a worthwhile investment."
 institution_events.21.b: "My stomach upsets too easily..."
 institution_events.22.t: "Slave Traders"
 institution_events.22.d: "The numbers of [slaver_country.GetAdjective] merchants who seek out our markets have grown from a trickle to a steady stream. Their main interest seems to be in procuring slaves either directly or through purchasing trade goods we have that can be traded for slaves. So far this has made a few local chieftains very rich, which is a dangerous development as it both empowers these local potentates and impoverishes the surrounding settlements.\n\nThe slave traders of [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] are asking that we create a more consistent framework and regulate the trade through royal monopolies. The [slaver_country.GetAdjective] traders themselves also seem interested in more formal and permanent arrangements."
 institution_events.22.a: "Make a deal with the traders."
 institution_events.22.b: "We cannot tolerate the sale of human lives."
 institution_events.23.t: "The [From.GetAdjective] Slave Trade"
 institution_events.23.d: "The [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has contacted us and offered our traders in [slaving_point.GetName] a monopoly on the slave trade in [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] lands. In return for trading directly with [From.Monarch.GetHerHim] rather than any of the local chiefs that have supplied us so far, [From.Monarch.GetSheHe] offers us a guarantee of a steady and growing supply along with [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] protection."
 institution_events.23.a: "Sounds like a great deal!"
 institution_events.23.b: "Our arrangements with the locals are working fine."
 institution_events.24.t: "A Slaver [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 institution_events.24.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] traders were delighted at our proposal to regulate the volatile slave trade market and the market in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is already growing rapidly. Not everyone arriving in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is a merchants, however"
 institution_events.24.a: "Let us welcome these friends from far-away lands."
 institution_events.25.t: "Regulations Fail"
 institution_events.25.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] traders have refused to acknowledge our monopoly and are continuing to trade directly with the local chiefs in [slaver_province.GetAreaName]. If we don't act quickly, we may soon see local strongmen funding their own private armies against the central authorities in the area."
 institution_events.25.a: "We must crush disobedient chiefs!"
 institution_events.25.b: "We must bide our time."
 institution_events.26.t: "Rapid Loss of Authority"
 institution_events.26.d: "Slavers have devastated the countryside of [Root.GetName]. As a direct result of unsanctioned raids, slavers from our capital have turned on our own population to line their own pockets. These traders are not only destroying our own population centers, they are building a powerbase for themselves that will be most dangerous in the long term."
 institution_events.26.a: "Another great inconvenience..."
 institution_events.26.b: "We must restore order!"
 institution_events.30.t: "Circulation of Hostile Publications"
 institution_events.30.d: "When printing was a novelty it first attracted those who would create codices as great works of art or philanthropists who wanted to spread the knowledge of the classics in a more accessible format. Soon, however, others joined their ranks, less scrupulous men who would make a living slandering others. Ever since printing started to mature as a business, presses all over Europe have been available for demagogues to spin their webs of lies. Piles of pamphlets lie ready to be distributed to anyone who will believe them as we speak. In [institution_province.GetAreaName] in particular this otherwise so promising technology has been put to use as a means to spread vicious slanders about our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and undermine the state. This cannot be tolerated!"

This way the young scions of the great European houses can pay their respect to the great rulers, minds and institutions of our age while also bringing new ideas and contacts with them back to their home. We should consider sending [Root.Heir.GetName] on such a pilgrimage to further [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] education and the future prospects of our country.\n\nOf course, an heir to a country such as ours would be expected to travel in a certain style..."

Our European friends in [institution_country.GetUsableName] have now extended an offer to us to send [Root.Heir.GetName] on a similar journey. To a certain extent their offer reeks of arrogance, but the things [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] could learn there may prove very valuable to [Root.GetUsableName]."

 institution_events.52.t: "Expansion of a Trade Factory"
 institution_events.52.d: "[trade_company_country.GetAdjective] traders active in our lands have approached the local authorities in [trade_company_province.GetName] asking to be allowed to expand an existing factory there by building a fort and being permitted to collect taxes from those of our subjects living within a certain radius of their factory. The traders argue that if we give them these rights they will not only be able to compensate us financially, but also that the increased commerce and traffic to our ports in the province will lead to a general growth of the region's importance in international trade.\n\nWe would, however, be allowing these Europeans to expand at the expense of our own merchants..."
 institution_events.52.a: "Grant them the right to expand their business."
 institution_events.52.b: "We cannot allow this!"
 institution_events.53.t: "Trading Concessions"
 institution_events.53.d: "Enterprising traders operating in [trade_company_province.GetName], a [From.GetAdjective] port, have managed to acquire substantial concessions from the local ruler. They have expanded their factory and built a small fort from which they control part of the region. This new arrangement allows the local ruler access to the global trade network, but it could also be used as an easy excuse for more direct expansion into [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] lands..."
 institution_events.53.a: "Excellent..."
 institution_events.53.a.tt: "[From.GetAdjective] trade power has been reduced and we have acquired a claim on one of their provinces. Should [From.GetUsableName] chose to expel our traders in the future, we may acquire a ??YTrade War??! Casus Belli on them."
 institution_events.54.t: "Traders Complain"
 institution_events.54.d: "Enterprising traders operating in [trade_company_province.GetName], a [From.GetAdjective] port, have tried to acquire substantial concessions from the local ruler. Their handling of the situation seems to have been less than diplomatic, however, and has ended with the local ruler denouncing both them and us."
 institution_events.54.a: "[From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] will regret this."
 institution_events.60.t: "Proto-Industrialization"
 institution_events.60.da: "For centuries, the mines and forges of [Root.GetName] have been famous beyond the lands of [Root.Owner.GetUsableName] for the high output and quality of the iron produced there. The province is also unique due to the way work has been organized in these industries, a method that has been refined and recently adopted in some other parts of the country."
 institution_events.60.db: "The cannon foundries of [Root.GetName] are famously efficient. It has been suggested that other parts of our country could benefit from adopting the methods pioneered there. Making that happen would be quite an investment but perhaps a worthwhile one..."
 institution_events.60.dc: "As rare and valuable as silk is, there is a fair deal of secrecy around 'producing' it and creating the exquisite fabrics the market craves. The silk weavers in [Root.GetName] have begun to pioneer a number of new mechanical solutions to some of the more common problems they face, which together with a more rigorous work organization has greatly increased output in the province. With the proper support, it is possible we could spread these innovations to other sectors, but it would not come for free..."
 institution_events.60.dd: "The famous weavers of [Root.GetCapitalName] have come to dominate the economic sector of the entire [Root.GetName] province. Over time, production has shifted from many small businesses to larger and larger organizations controlled by merchant capitalist investors. This system has been so successful for the investors behind it that they are now looking into ways to spread their methods to other parts of the country. To do so, however, they are asking for our support."
 institution_events.60.a: "We should spread this method to all parts of our country."

 institution_events.72.d: "Today, a most unusual group of people arrived in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] asking for an audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. The leader of the group introduced himself as the representative of an institution of learning in a faraway land. They state that their mission in our lands is to document, measure and categorize our plants, wildlife and society. They wish to learn everything they can about our country and then take this knowledge elsewhere so that others may compare what they find to other parts of the world. It is quite clear that these are men of learning and that we could probably put some of that knowledge to good use. If we allow them to travel our lands as freely as they wish, however, we risk dangerous intelligence falling into the hands of what may well be foreign spies..."
 institution_events.72.a: "We must learn from these fascinating men."
 institution_events.72.b: "We cannot allow them to penetrate our countryside."
 institution_events.73.t: "Healthy Criticism?"
 institution_events.73.da: "Public houses, coffee houses and other places where the public can convene and discuss have traditionally often also been hotbeds of criticism and discontent towards our rulers. This has changed lately, however, as the political discussion has become more widespread among a more engaged general population. While much of the discussion is not strictly aimed at lambasting the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] government, it seems it still often reflects very poorly on us.\n\nSome would say that we could benefit from this free discussion, but others recommend that we close down these public areas immediately."
 institution_events.73.db: "For as long as anyone can remember, shadow puppet theater has been a popular form of entertainment in coffee houses throughout the Near East and South Asia. The comic relief provided by stock characters such as Karagoz and Hacivat coupled with the possibilities for satirical adaption to current events have allowed the genre to outlive many empires.\n\nRecently, however, local officials in [Root.GetName] are reporting a sharp rise in public ridicule being directed at the government in [Root.Owner.Capital.GetCapitalName] following several highly critical puppet shows. While this is likely a symptom of a greater dissatisfaction with our inability to adapt to the new ideals spreading in our country, the quickest way to address the problem is likely to silence these puppeteers and restore order to the public houses of the area."

One of the female passengers was the daughter of an important noble and he is crying out for vengeance. There are heavy implications that these pirates are under someone's protection."

 trade.3.d: "Our merchants have been too successful in trade, and the owners of a local trade node are upholding their mercantilist ideals and are now attempting to expel our merchants from it."
 trade.3.a: "They stay!"
 trade.3.b: "The merchants will keep a lower profile"
 trade.4.t: "Trade Crisis"
 trade.4.d: "Our merchants report that they are facing stiffening resistance to trying to peddle their wares. They are talking like it is the end of the world, and fear they will never earn a copper again in life."
 trade.4.a: "It is just merchants"
 trade.4.b: "Try to alleviate them"
 trade.5.t: "Merchant Bankrupt!"
 trade.5.d: "One of our merchants abroad has returned home as a pauper after losing every single ducat. He has gone bankrupt, and we will not receive benefits of his trade anymore."

 trade.8.a: "This was not quite the plan"
 trade.9.t: "Taking advantage of our trade"
 trade.9.d: "Our mercantilist policies have engendered a breed of administrator that is good at getting our merchants to pay their dues. One such man has recently come to our attention as being particularly outstanding."
 trade.9.a: "He may go on to do great things"
 trade.10.t: "Lack of protection"

 catholic_flavor.1.t: "The Council of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 catholic_flavor.1.d: "His Holiness, the Pope, has tasked a commission of cardinals with addressing the challenges posed by the Protestant movement. While the Catholic faith itself must not be compromised, His Holiness and most cardinals are willing to admit that some Protestant complaints are valid. Therefore, the Council advises many changes to the administration of the Church, a stop to absentee Bishops and the worldly excesses of the clergy. In addition, several new monastic orders are to be founded, to aid in the efforts of the Counter-Reformation."
 catholic_flavor.1.a: "About Time!"
 catholic_flavor.2.t: "The Kingdom of God on Earth"
 catholic_flavor.2.d: "Having united the whole of Italy under the banner of Catholicism, the Pope has seen fit to declare it 'The Kingdom of God'. Catholics from all over Europe flock to his banner, eager to live in this model nation of Christian virtue. Foreign powers can no longer control the College of Cardinals, but neither will they pay much heed to any Papal bulls or decrees."
 catholic_flavor.2.a: "All Men under one God!"
 catholic_flavor.2.b: "Amen"
 catholic_flavor.3.t: "The Pentarchy"
 catholic_flavor.3.d: "Having brought all five Patriarchates back into the Christian - Orthodox - fold, we have restored the old Pentarchy, thus effectively ending the great East-West Schism. While some countries might continue to cling to Catholicism, the Pope has lost his vaunted primacy as the lawful successor of St Peter and Bishop of Rome."
 catholic_flavor.3.a: "The Wound is Healed!"
 catholic_flavor.4.t: "Simony?"
 catholic_flavor.4.d: "We have a vacancy in high position in the church administration of $CAPITAL$. There is a churchman from a rich family who has made an offer. If we approve and back his election to the position, we will gain a large contribution to our coffers. Some more devout people claim that this is a sin called Simony, but what do they know?"
 catholic_flavor.4.a: "We need the money!"
 catholic_flavor.4.b: "It is a sin!"
 catholic_flavor.5.t: "Selling of Indulgences"
 catholic_flavor.5.d: "'As soon as a coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory springs!', in the words of Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar who has made it his mission to collect indulgences for the Pope. Promising absolution from earthly sins in return for money, he has been highly active in saving the souls of the rich - and that, in a way that doesn't even require them to give up their vices! However, this practice has raised eyebrows among the [Root.GetAdjective] clergy, who are uncomfortable with the idea that the Pope should enrich himself in such a manner. Instead, they call for Christians to show true repentence if their sins are to be forgiven.\n\nAs [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] grows older, the disputes on the matter grow more personal. [Root.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] has sinned, as every [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] must to keep their rule secure. How best should [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] acquire forgiveness?"
 catholic_flavor.5.a: "A donation to the Pope shall be arranged."
 catholic_flavor.5.b: "Indulgences are the easy option; repentence is better."
 catholic_flavor.6.t: "Veneration of Relics"
 catholic_flavor.6.d: "From the highest to the very low, the people believe that the veneration of will allows the viewer to reduce their time in purgatory. A treatise opposing this practice has been found nailed to the door of one of our churches in [unrest_province.GetName] that has a very substantial relic collection. Is there any truth in their complaints, or are they merely naysayers and heretics seeking to harm the unity of church, our one true path to salvation?"
 catholic_flavor.6.a: "But I just bought a vial of the milk of the Virgin Mary."
 catholic_flavor.6.b: "Forgiveness can only come from God."
 catholic_flavor.7.t: "Veneration of the Virgin Mary"
 catholic_flavor.7.d: "The Blessed Virgin Mary, mother of our Lord Jesus Christ, is the Queen of heaven and mediator of many graces. There is no more perfect woman and her holy motherhood grants her a seat at the right hand of God. Or does it? Recently, radical theologians have been arguing that there is no need for such intercessions. Are they right, or is the holy mother church in danger from their almost heretical utterings?"
 catholic_flavor.7.a: "May the Madonna forgive them."
 catholic_flavor.7.b: "She is a special woman, but still just a woman."
 catholic_flavor.8.t: "The Doctrine of Particular Judgment"
 catholic_flavor.8.d: "As we know, when we die, God judges immediately and decides a soul's fate until it awaits the last judgment. However, a monk has started a doctrinal dispute that verges on the edge of heresy, claiming that there is no purgatory and saying that prayers for the dead do not assist their passage into heaven. These disputes are threatening the very unity of our church."
 catholic_flavor.8.a: "He is probably a heretic."
 catholic_flavor.8.b: "Sorry, there is nothing you can do for your dead loved ones."
 catholic_flavor.9.t: "A New Confession of Faith"
 catholic_flavor.9.d: "Reformers have put forward a new confession of faith that has some minor, but still serious, differences with Catholic teachings. The church claims it borders on the heretical, while there are those who suggest it would bring the Church and its administrative apparatus under tighter control."
 catholic_flavor.9.a: "Promote it."
 catholic_flavor.9.b: "Nay, it will damn everyone."
 catholic_flavor.10.t: "A Promise of Safe Passage?"
 catholic_flavor.10.d: "One of the so called reforming monks has recently appeared at our court under our most solemn promise of safe passage to argue the justness of his cause. Like Hus before him, his heresy is manifest but our word has been given."
 catholic_flavor.10.a: "Our honor is our word."
 catholic_flavor.10.b: "We are not bound by promises to a heretic."

 republics.2.b: "Mercantilism is vital for the state"
 republics.3.t: "Rise of a Despot"
 republics.3.d: "The lack of respect for the republic has slowly eroded its foundations. To preserve the stability of the state, $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ has proclaimed $RULER_O_PRONOUN$self dictator for life."
 republics.3.a: "Long live $MONARCH$!"
 republics.4.t: "The Trial"
 republics.4.d: "My most noble $MONARCHTITLE$, your eldest son is on trial for corruption and bribery. There is no doubt that the charges are true, the conviction of your eldest son would be a serious personal blow to you. On the other hand we could of course interfere in the trial and secure his innocence."
 republics.4.a: "Withdraw from public life"
 republics.4.b: "See him acquitted"
 republics.5.t: "A New Coin"
 republics.5.d: "In times past the $MONARCHTITLE$ used to be on the reverse side of the coins, now the republic rejects such personality cults. If we were to issue a new high purity coin we could improve people's faith in the coinage and of course all should remember who did this."
 republics.5.a: "Reject the Reform"
 republics.5.b: "Let the coins be issued"
 republics.6.t: "Foreign Plots?"
 republics.6.d: "Wild rumors are circulating about our nobility plotting with foreign powers. Hysteria grows and the mood is fearful. The people demand that we strike at the traitors, but wiser minds say that we must let the tradition of republican justice take its course."
 republics.6.a: "Seize them and their wealth"
 republics.6.b: "Justice is above all"
 republics.7.t: "Expand the Bodyguard"
 republics.7.d: "The office of $MONARCHTITLE$ is challenged by enemies within and without, and thus a strong personal bodyguard is essential to ensure that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] remains in power. The turbulent politics of our time require this, but there are those who decry it, claiming that this new trend displays aristocratic tendencies and subverts the traditions of the Republic."
 republics.7.a: "Do it!"
 republics.7.b: "It would violate our Republican Ideals!"
 republics.8.t: "The Firebrand Preacher"
 republics.8.d: "A preacher has appeared prophesying the end of all we know and a new beginning. The preacher gained traction with our recent war but he isn't really pushing for the kind of republic we know. We could challenge him to a trail by fire, but this could create internal problems just when we need unity."
 republics.8.a: "Allow it!"
 republics.8.b: "Give him a Trial by Fire!"
 republics.9.t: "Noble Plot"
 republics.9.d: "With the republic looking fragile rumors have reached us that nobles are plotting to bring in hereditary succession to our great Republic."
 republics.9.a: "This is concerning"
 republics.10.t: "Division in the Council"
 republics.10.d: "The republic functions because of the agreed common purpose of the rulers who in turn represent the settled will of the ruled. Our republic has been turning back on the traditions that made us strong. The lack of cohesion in our ruling council is costing us militarily."
 republics.10.a: "This is not good!"
 republics.11.t: "Disputes affecting governments"
 republics.11.d: "Republics are successful when the important families are ready to put the republic's interest on a par with their own. Currently our republican traditions are under pressure and families are putting their own interests ahead of the republics. This is hurting our ability to govern, as consensus is harder to achieve."
 republics.11.a: "This is bad!"
 republics.12.t: "Trade Wars"
 republics.12.d: "We always encouraged health competition between our merchants, but at the same time they always put the greater interest of the republic first. We would work together to ensure that the republic's trade was strengthened against the interest of rivals. Now this tradition is waning and the merchant class is becoming increasing fratricidal. This is hurting our country..."
 republics.12.a: "Something has to be done!"
 republics.13.t: "Ceremony Disrupted"
 republics.13.d: "One of the core parts of a republic are the great ceremonies of state. This is a time where disagreements and disputes between the patricians are put on hold so we can display our unity of purpose and show the world our strength. At a recent ceremony disgruntled elements turned their backs on our traditions to air their disagreements with the ruling council."
 republics.13.a: "Far from ideal!"
 muslim_piety.1.t: "Spread of Extreme Practices in [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]"
 muslim_piety.1.d: "The late Middle Ages saw the emergence of several new forms of Islamic mysticism, one of the most controversial being a brand of Sufi dervishes known as the 'renunciationists'. These men sought to separate themselves entirely from normal society, shaving all body hair down to their eyebrows and publicly breaking the rules of the Sharia in order to demonstrate their unique relationship with God, all while wandering from town to town begging for alms. Our religious scholars are calling for their persecution, arguing that the uneducated populace's tendency to view them with awe will lead them away from the true faith."
 muslim_piety.1.a: "Expel them from [spread_of_extreme_practices_province.GetAreaName]."
 muslim_piety.1.b: "Leave them be."
 muslim_piety.2.t: "Returning Scholars"
 muslim_piety.2.d: "Particularly in the aftermath of the Mongol conquests of the thirteenth century, Egypt and Syria emerged as the foremost centers of scholarly learning in the Muslim world. Sunni scholars of every persuasion flocked to Damascus and Cairo to learn from the most renowned teachers of science, theology, and above all law, while Shi'ites traveled to Jabal Amil in Lebanon to meet with the scholars of orthodox Twelver Shi'ism. Many students from our lands, having completed their educational pilgrimage, are now returning home and hoping to implement legalistic Islam in our [Root.GovernmentName] just as they learned it in the heartlands of Islam."
 muslim_piety.2.a: "They will make a welcome addition to our country."
 muslim_piety.2.b: "Contact with the divine is not about studying books."
 muslim_piety.3.t: "Sufi Organizations Rally Support"
 muslim_piety.3.d: "During the early modern period popular forms of Sufi worship became extremely widespread in the Muslim world. Seeing the weakened state of our armies, the sheikh of a major order has begun urging his followers to take up arms in support of us against our enemies."
 muslim_piety.3.a: "We cannot rely on mystics for support!"
 muslim_piety.3.b: "Let us welcome these warriors of faith."
 muslim_piety.4.t: "Religious Harmony"
 muslim_piety.4.d: "Just as many members of the Ulema have developed Sufi leanings, many of our Sufi orders have likewise come to extol the virtue of a pious life lived in accordance with the Sharia. Despite disapproving voices on both extremes, we have managed to strike a balance between mysticism and legalism. Our realm is currently enjoying the fruits of moderation and tolerance of differing religious practices."
 muslim_piety.4.a: "God is good."
 muslim_piety.5.t: "Debate over the Philosophy of Ibn Arabi"
 muslim_piety.5.d: "Ibn Arabi was an Andalusian scholar and mystic, regarded by many Sufis as the foremost spiritual master. His pantheistic philosophy of the 'unity of being' viewed all of creation as a manifestation of God, and invited worshippers to see divine beauty in all aspects of life, not merely in the traditional rituals of Islam. Ever since, debates have raged on over the compatibility of his philosophy with scholarly interpretations of Islam, with some going so far as to label him an unbeliever. For many Sufis, on the other hand, Ibn Arabi's philosophy became the foundational principle of their religious practice. Now we too are being asked to take sides."
 muslim_piety.5.a: "Deny the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.5.b: "Support the unity of being."
 muslim_piety.6.t: "Dhimmi Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.6.d: "Under Islamic Law, non-Muslims faced a number of restrictions on the construction of new buildings in urban centers"
 muslim_piety.6.a: "Enforce the letter of the law."
 muslim_piety.6.b: "Leave them to do as they please."
 muslim_piety.7.t: "Dhimmis Flout Building Restrictions"
 muslim_piety.7.d: "Despite being officially prohibited from constructing houses of worship and tall buildings, the Dhimmis in several provinces of our realm are openly disobeying the laws, and many of our qadis are too lax to respond, either because they see no harm in it or because of the hefty bribes they can earn for turning a blind eye."
 muslim_piety.7.a: "Increase enforcement efforts."
 muslim_piety.7.b: "Let the laws go unenforced."
 muslim_piety.8.t: "Enjoining Right and Forbidding Wrong"
 muslim_piety.8.d: "Muslims are encouraged in the Qur'an to take an active role in their community in order to ?genjoin right and forbid wrong.?h While this command has been interpreted in many ways by Muslim scholars, it was sometimes used by reformist groups to justify the forceful spread of more extreme views. A group of charismatic mosque preachers in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] have begun calling for the end of unorthodox religious practices and are inciting the populace against the Sufis, leading to violence and street battles."
 muslim_piety.8.a: "Stamp down on the movement."
 muslim_piety.8.b: "Offer them our support."
 muslim_piety.9.t: "Debate over Sufi Practices"
 muslim_piety.9.d: "Muslim scholars were not united on the question of the permissibility of Sufism. While most appreciated the heightened levels of religious devotion it inspired among the general population, some disapproved of how certain Sufis expressed their faith. Poetry and song about wine and illicit love, as well as communal dancing and veneration for the tombs of those regarded as saints, could at times provoke opposition from more hardline elements of the Ulema."
 muslim_piety.9.a: "Support the hardliners."
 muslim_piety.9.b: "Support the moderates."
 muslim_piety.10.t: "Purification of Tax Laws"
 muslim_piety.10.d: "Ensuring that the realm's laws operate in accordance with the sacred Sharia requires us to occasionally re-examine our tax-collection practices, and to strive to align them as closely as possible with the legal positions held by the great lawmakers of our [Root.GetReligiousSchool] school. This means eliminating the customary taxes which have accumulated over the years, and taking only what is permitted by the Sharia."
 muslim_piety.10.a: "The peasantry must be free from unlawful exactions."
 muslim_piety.10.b: "Reject the proposal."
 muslim_piety.11.t: "Mystics and Storytellers"
 muslim_piety.11.d: "Many among the Ulema would question the great influence that storytellers have over the life of common men. The traditional hero stories of our people are centuries old but they risk making a cult out of seriously distorted fates of historical figures. A prominent cleric in [storytellerprovince.GetAreaName] have taken a strong stand against the storytellers of the realm, and cautions that religious scholars of the past have warned that obsessive listening to stories could lead to false worship."
 muslim_piety.11.a: "We must ban offensive stories from the realm."
 muslim_piety.11.b: "There is nothing wrong in idealizing our ancestors."
 muslim_piety.12.t: "Trade Guilds and Fraternities"
 muslim_piety.12.d: "Guilds and fraternities are a constant factor in the public life of the [Root.GovernmentName], in many ways these are small communities within the community, with their own rules, customs and even laws. It is also very common for these associations to indulge in mystic traditions, sufism and often unorthodox adaption of the Sharia. Something that sometimes makes it hard for the laws of the Ulema to penetrate the urban milieu.\nAn artisan in [fraternity_province.GetName] has reached out to the state, warning us of a local guildsman with a great influence on local affairs. Anyone wishing to take up a craft in the city is currently required to be approved by this man and then swear an oath of allegiance."
 muslim_piety.12.a: "This is unacceptable."
 muslim_piety.12.b: "Let us not interfere with the guilds."
 muslim_piety.13.t: "Social Dissent and Popular Sufism"
 muslim_piety.13.d: "The great stress that our government has placed on Legalism and the limiting of Mysticism in our society has had the effect of closely associating Sufism with resistance to central rule. In times of social distress many now look to the Mystical orders for spiritual guidance as an alternative to the highly legalistic Ulema and its [Root.GovernmentName] ally.\nAs tensions flare in [popular_sufism_province.GetName] an influential Sufi Master declared his support for [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], potentially calming the situation."
 muslim_piety.13.a: "We cannot accept the support of a Mystic."
 muslim_piety.13.b: "God is good."
 muslim_piety.14.t: "Coffee and Tobacco"
 muslim_piety.14.d: "While they are quite new to our society the use of stimulants such as Coffee and Tobacco has spread quickly, with coffee houses now a common feature from [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to [coffee_province.GetAreaName]. The popularity is especially marked among the Sufi orders. The novelty of these substances means that the religious establishment is divided on their proper use.\nMany strict legalists wants us to limit their use while others argue for caution, as both Coffee and Tobacco are very popular in our state. The local governor of [coffee_province.GetName] have now turned to [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] wanting to close down the local coffee houses that he believes have become meeting places for dissidents."
 muslim_piety.14.a: "Let us impose Restrictions."
 muslim_piety.14.b: "Let them have their coffee."
 muslim_piety.15.t: "Sufi Orders growing in popularity in [new_province.GetName]"
 muslim_piety.15.d: "Some of the more prevalent Sufi orders in [Root.GetName] have quickly started to establish themselves in the newly acquired [new_province.GetName] province. While the locals seem somewhat hesitant about [Root.GetAdjective] rule they have embraced the orders and this has greatly eased the integration of the province into our [Root.GovernmentName]."
 muslim_piety.15.a: "Strengthen the legal establishment instead."
 muslim_piety.15.b: "This is excellent."
 muslim_piety.16.t: "Disregard of the Sharia?"
 muslim_piety.16.d: "The learned Ulema complain over the widespread flouting of Sharia rules in our [Root.GovernmentName]. They demand that we reduce the influence of Mystic orders and heterodoxy in the country. Failing to comply could see us risking losing their support and many of these valuable legal scholars might even leave for other courts."
 muslim_piety.16.a: "Let us follow their recommendations."
 muslim_piety.16.b: "We cannot give in to such threats."
 muslim_piety.17.t: "Building Restrictions Lapse"
 muslim_piety.17.d: "As our realm loses its zeal for legalistic Islam, it has become harder and harder for us to find and appoint qadis willing to fully implement our official restrictions on the construction of Dhimmi buildings. The law has, at this point, simply become unenforceable."
 muslim_piety.17.a: "Just as well."
 muslim_piety.20.t: "A New [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 muslim_piety.20.d: "Our nation has sorely lacked a firm guiding hand under the rule of [Root.Heir.GetName], a timid child, ill-prepared to face the dangers of the world. Fortunately for us all, one of [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] uncles, and close advisors has decided to act. The child is now safely locked away where [Root.Heir.GetSheHe] can do no more harm. The advisor has been proclaimed our new [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], and has sworn to provide our nation with the strong leadership it so desperately needs."
 muslim_piety.20.a: "May our new $MONARCHTITLE$'s rule be long and prosperous!"
 muslim_dlc.22.t: "Friday Prayers?"
 muslim_dlc.22.d: "The weekly congregational prayer has been a way for Islamic rulers to show their legitimacy for centuries. The long standing Sunni dominance where most Friday prayers have been in the name of the Sunni Caliphs and the worldly Sultans of the Sunni world, has however lead to the status of the prayers being very uncertain.\nMost among the Shia Ulema oppose the practice of the Friday prayers, but there are some who would see its role as a way to bind together society, Ulema and ruler, return to the Shia faithful of our country."
 muslim_dlc.22.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] will lead the Friday prayers and our country will pray."
 muslim_dlc.22.b: "We must respect the traditions of our people."

 cultural_event.1.d: "Hear ye, hear ye! Let loose Pantalone, Harlequin, and all the other stock characters of the traditional Commedia dell'Arte on your unsuspecting population, and watch as they are entertained by the antics and the shenanigans. A good piece of comedy can make anyone forget for a while that their everyday lives are wasted away laboring under the yokes of tyrannical rulers. Plus, it's fun!"
 cultural_event.1.a: "Make it happen!"

 cultural_event.2.t: "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite"
 cultural_event.2.d: "Like a mighty torch, bringing the light of reason into even the darkest corners of the old and new worlds, the Enlightenment is sweeping across the world. Supporting this movement will doubtlessly lead to advances in science and philosophy, but the movement's notions about human freedom and the unalienable rights of man may cause a bit of a rebellious fervor in our country."
 cultural_event.2.a: "Let us embrace these ideas!"
 cultural_event.2.b: "No, it's not worth the risk"
 cultural_event.3.t: "Byzantine Refugees"
 cultural_event.3.d: "My Lord, Byzantium has fallen to the Saracens. The last bastion of the Roman Empire, the City of Constantine, is now in Turkish hands. As Christendom reels from the shock, Byzantine refugees flock to the cities and courts of Europe, bringing with them old manuscripts of classical knowledge, tracts by Aristotle, Plato and Galen, and a thorough knowledge of both Latin and Greek. Inviting these refugees to $COUNTRY$ might provide an enormous boost to our own efforts in the fields of culture and science."
 cultural_event.3.a: "By all means, let them come!"
 cultural_event.3.b: "No, we don't need their help"
 cultural_event.4.t: "Support The Florentine School"
 cultural_event.4.d: "Because of our relative notability, we are in a position to support the Italian artists in the Florentine School. Being perceived as patrons of international art will definitely help our propaganda efforts."
 cultural_event.4.a: "Of course. They shall have our support"
 cultural_event.4.b: "No, we have enough problems"
 cultural_event.5.t: "The Last Jousting Tournament"
 cultural_event.5.d: "We can feel it in the wind. Soon our equestrian elite will be nothing more than a dream remembered, as the chivalrous tradition dies out before the onslaught of modernity. The world is changing, but for now, for one last time"
 cultural_event.5.a: "Forward, to glory!"
 cultural_event.5.b: "No, we need to get with the times"
 cultural_event.6.t: "Charter a Guild of St. Luke"
 cultural_event.6.d: "Saint Luke, the patron saint of artists, often came to lend his name to artists guilds in Western Europe, the most famous, perhaps, in Antwerp. Chartering a guild here in $COUNTRY$ might be a tad on the expensive side, but the cultural benefit will be there for all to see. Developing the Guild's bureaucracy will also strengthen our native bureaucratic tradition."
 cultural_event.7.t: "Golden Age of Dutch Painting"
 cultural_event.7.d: "The Dutch Republic, recently Calvinist, recently independent, and with strong undercurrents of humanistic thought and philosophy, had in the late 16th century set the philosophical stage for a break with the established artistic traditions and ideals of the old Catholic Europe. Riding on the back of the wealth coming in from the developing trade through Amsterdam, we could help usher in a Golden Age for Dutch painting."
 cultural_event.8.t: "Diwani Script"
 cultural_event.8.d: "A cursive style of Arabic calligraphy, originated in the Ottoman Empire of the 15th and 16th centuries, the Diwani Script was thus named for its intended use on royal decrees issued by the Ottoman Diwan, the cabinet of the Ottoman state. Strengthen our rule by proclaiming our edicts, and the word of God, in the harmonies of calligraphy."
 cultural_event.8.a: "Make it so!"
 cultural_event.8.b: "An unnecessary distraction"
 cultural_event.9.t: "The Way of Tea"
 cultural_event.9.d: "While tea had been grown in Japan at least since the 9th century, the more refined aesthetics of the Chanoyu, The Way of Tea, only developed fully during the early parts of the 15th century. Part religious ceremony, and part cultural tradition, The Way of Tea could become an integral part of our cultural heritage."
 cultural_event.10.t: "Endorse Renaissance Philosophy"
 cultural_event.10.d: "You, with no limit and no bound, may choose for yourself the limits and bounds of your nature. We have placed you at the world's center so that you may survey everything else in the world.\n\n--Mirandola, Piccolo -- 'Oration on The Dignity of Man'"
 cultural_event.11.t: "The South German Organ Tradition"

 EVTNAME858: "Incompetent Diplomacy!"
 EVTDESC858: "It is almost inconceivable how incompetent $MONARCH$ is when handling diplomacy. We do not know how $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ did it, but $RULER_S_PRONOUN$ managed to hurt our diplomatic standing in the world with a single letter of apology to an ambassador."
 EVTOPTA858: "How can it be possible?"
 EVTDESC9471: "Borders are organic things, changing and mutating with the seasons, and with the fortunes of the latest conqueror passing by. Historians will, perhaps, say that the events that transpired in $PROVINCENAME$ in the year $YEAR$, were inevitable. 'As $PROVINCENAME$ continued to flourish under the benevolent rule of $COUNTRY$, the yokels on the other side of the border were bound to get jealous.' Perhaps they will be less fair to us.

 EVTOPTB1072: "Seek diplomatic compromise"
 EVTNAME1073: "National Fragmentation"
 EVTDESC1073: "Although comprising a vast area, $COUNTRY$ is politically a rather shattered nation. $MONARCH$'s power over the empire has been severely limited by various local rulers and he is faced with increasing difficulty administering the large empire.

 EVTNAME2002: "Spread of Protestantism"
 EVTDESC2002: "The increased secularization of the Papacy and their accentuation on rituals has gradually evoked concern across Europe.

A majority of the citizens of $PROVINCENAME$ have begun to question the authority and actions of their religious leaders."

 EVTOPTA2011: "Only time will tell what this might bring"
 EVTNAME2012: "Spread of the Reformation"
 EVTDESC2012: "After the publication of 'The Institutes of the Christian Church', introducing the central principles and ideas of the theological reformation, the social, political and philosophical attitude of Europe has begun to alter.

 EVTNAME2035: "Empty Words"

 EVTNAME3012: "Religious Intolerance"
 EVTDESC3012: "With new ideas spreading through our nation, lively debates have sprung up surrounding the position of religious minorities in [Root.GetUsableName]. While advocates for religious freedom have seized upon the chance to call for reforms to improve the situation of followers of the [minority_religion_province.Religion.GetName] faith and other minorities in the country, reactionaries are pushing for a full-scale clampdown against them.

 EVTNAME3022: "Peasant Protests"
 EVTDESC3022: "Regional revolts and protests are erupting all over our nation. Furious peasants are demanding immediate reforms of the social and political order. The weight of the heavy taxes and the cruelty of their landlords have finally driven them over the edge."
 EVTOPTA3022: "Enforce serfdom"
 EVTOPTB3022: "Restrict serfdom"
 EVTNAME3023: "Religious Revolt"
 EVTDESC3023: "The ideas of the reformation have appealed to a large number of the oppressed peasantry. The appeal is in many cases based on social motives, many believe that they will receive support and that their hardship will lessen. This isn't necessarily the case, as the revolt has gained momentum and atrocities at the hands of the peasants have become more widespread, the reformists have begun to oppose the 'murderous peasants'."
 EVTOPTA3023: "Crush them!"
 EVTOPTB3023: "Let them choose their own faith"
 EVTNAME3024: "Obsolete Forces"
 EVTDESC3024: "Military research and the introduction of gunpowder has more or less made our former armed forces obsolete. Their high status being something of the past, they now find themselves struck by poverty and frustration. Their misery has gone beyond reason and they are pressuring the authority for financial aid."
 EVTOPTA3024: "They have no place in our society"
 EVTOPTB3024: "They may still be of some use"
 EVTNAME3025: "National Decentralization"
 EVTDESC3025: "During the first stages of the Peasants' War, the rebels have gained ground simply by overwhelming the lords and knights. Due to our already politically decentralized nation, what started out as several smaller, local uprisings has spread over the provincial borders and engulfed a larger part of our nation."
 EVTOPTA3025: "Crush the rebels"
 EVTOPTB3025: "We have to negotiate a solution"
 EVTNAME3026: "The End of the Peasants' War"
 EVTDESC3026: "The instability of the past years now finally seems to be over! We no longer have to worry about peasants fighting for reforms. Their will to fight have been drained."
 EVTOPTA3026: "Restore order"
 EVTNAME3051: "Cultural Unrest"
 EVTDESC3051: "The ongoing oppression and exploitation of the minority population in one of our provinces has finally reached its boiling point. The citizens of the province are up in arms against our rule."
 EVTOPTA3051: "Suppress the rebels"
 EVTOPTB3051: "Let us try to negotiate"
 EVTNAME3071: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Enter Our Colony"
 EVTDESC3071: "As our colony in [Root.GetName] has continued to grow and develop, we have begun to encroach on the territory belonging to a people referring to themselves as the ?g[Root.NativeCulture.GetName]?h. They send jeers and insults in their native tongue, and have even started raiding our settlements. One of our own men with a sympathy for these savages has learned the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] language and he tells us that they are claiming our colony in [Root.GetName] is encroaching on their ancestral land. Apparently they demand that we grant them concessions, or war will be inevitable."
 EVTOPTA3071: "Erase these savages from [Root.GetName]!"
 EVTOPTB3071: "Just pay them to stop hissing at us."
 EVTOPTC3071: "Offer them whatever they desire, we should live in peace."
 EVTNAME3072: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] Raids on Our Colonies"
 EVTDESC3072: "The [Root.Culture.GetName] settlers in [Root.GetName] are merely attempting to bring civilization to the savage lands of [Root.GetSuperRegionName] and enlighten it with superior [Root.Culture.GetGroupName] culture. However, it seems that the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] savages refuse to accept our superior ways, and our harsh treatment of these native people has only served to increase tensions between the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribesmen and our colonists. The only question now is how do we resolve this situation?"
 EVTOPTA3072: "We end it with a show of force!"
 EVTOPTB3072: "The situation can?ft be salvaged, abandon the colony."
 destroyed_colony_tt: "Our colony in ??Y[Root.GetName]??! will be abandoned!"
 EVTNAME3073: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Plead for Aid"
 EVTDESC3073: "It seems our harsh treatment of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people living in and around our colonies have had quite the adverse effect on their continued existence. A combination of the foreign diseases our colonists brought over both intentionally and unintentionally has devastated the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] populace living in [Root.GetName] and now their leaders have approached us begging us to relent and take pity on the suffering of their people."
 EVTOPTA3073: "These savages haven?ft known true suffering yet."
 EVTOPTB3073: "Perhaps we should show charity this once."
 EVTNAME3074: "Colonial Expansion"
 EVTDESC3074: "It would seem that our harsh treatment of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people living in [Root.GetName] has paid off in a massive way. Forcing those primitives off of their rich fertile soil has created new opportunities for [Root.Culture.GetName] settlers to take their place and our colonial companies have already begun exploiting the ancestral land of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName], but they request financial aid to complete the construction of the new settlement."
 EVTOPTA3074: "For glory, God, and gold!"
 EVTOPTB3074: "It's too expensive."
 EVTNAME3075: "Lucrative Trade Agreements With the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] Tribe"
 EVTDESC3075: "Lesser nations question what value there is in engaging the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people in trade, but our merchants know better. It seems that these people do not know the true value of what they hold, and we have a golden opportunity to strike riches from these people by taking massive stores of valuable goods and metals in exchange for some relatively trivial medical resources."
 EVTOPTA3075: "Make the deal!"
 EVTOPTB3075: "Make an investment in their tribe."
 EVTOPTC3075: "We will not exploit these people."
 EVTNAME3076: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Request Aid"
 EVTDESC3076: "It seems that the trading between our colonists in [Root.GetName] and the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] has led to an outbreak of diseases usually foreign to [Root.GetSuperRegionName]. They come to us with grizzly stories of bringing goods traded from our nation back to their tribe, only for it to infect their weak and elderly with a plethora of diseases their healers have never encountered before. All they ask is for a single free shipment of medical supplies, and they will gladly begin integrating with our colony."
 EVTOPTA3076: "Can the treasury bear such an expense?"
 EVTOPTB3076: "Give them everything they need and more!"
 EVTNAME3077: "[Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People Request [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] Conversion!"
 EVTDESC3077.A: "Although we have not been actively propagating our religion in [Root.GetName], many members of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe have been adopting the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] religion regardless and request to officially abandon their old faith in favor of ours and join our colony. We could take this offer and apply it to the entire [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe living close to our colony in [Root.GetName], but this may anger some of the more traditional [Root.OriginalReligion.GetName] members of their tribe."
 EVTDESC3077.B: "We have always made it our policy to propagate trade between our good people and the strange people of the new world. As of late, however, the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] traders have come to us asking not for food or medical supplies, but for symbols and tools of worship of the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith and many are even requesting to be ordained as priests so they may spread the faith amongst their entire tribe! If we accept, we will be united with the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people in faith, but we risk angering the more traditional [Root.OriginalReligion.GetName] members of their tribe."
 EVTDESC3077.C: "We have made it our holy duty to civilize the New World and enlighten the native people with our [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith. As our priests and missionaries perform their holy duty in [Root.GetName], they report being approached by some [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] shamans requesting to abandon their [Root.OriginalReligion.GetName] roots and join [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName] in [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] holy duty to propagate the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith amongst the unenlightened members of the local [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] tribe. If we accept, we will have a whole new clerical class of [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] to spread our faith, but we risk angering the more traditional [Root.OriginalReligion.GetName] members of their tribe."
 EVTOPTA3077: "Welcome to the faith!"
 EVTOPTB3077: "A good [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] allows [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetHerHis] people their ways."
 EVTNAME3079: "The Suffering of the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] People"
 EVTDESC3079: "To our horror, we have discovered that our mere presence in [Root.GetName] is causing massive damage to the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people! We have always strived to coexist with native people, but just glancing at the effect that foreign diseases have had on the local [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] villages is more than anyone can bear. The suffering of their people cannot be ignored, and if we do nothing then we risk bringing an end to the [Root.NativeCulture.GetName] people?c"
 EVTOPTA3079: "We simply can't afford it."
 EVTOPTB3079: "Give them everything they need!"
 EVTNAME3081: "Financial Ruin"
 EVTDESC3081: "For many years we have undercut our tax base. We have absolutely no control of the price-fluctuations from the inflow of silver and gold. The minister of finance is struggling to forecast any repayments as all costs are fluctuating wildly. The spending is based on the planned budget, but the inflow is irregular at best, making us spend more than we actually have."

 EVTNAME3092: "A Cry for Help"
 EVTDESC3092: "The opposition against $MONARCH$ has been attracting more supporters by the day and the possibility of a deposition is becoming very plausible. In a desperate attempt to save the throne and restore order, $MONARCH$ contemplates turning to $COUNTRY$'s foreign allies in [ally_country.GetUsableName] asking for help."

 EVTNAME3093: "Unscrupulous In-laws"
 EVTDESC3093: "A royal marriage can sometimes be a blessing, but in our weakened state due to the clash between the monarch and the aristocracy, it is nothing less than a curse. Our opportunistic in-laws regard this as the perfect timing to expand their influence and obtain more power. They have set their sights on [inlaws_province.GetName]. Unless we take action, our authority in the province will be greatly reduced."

 EVTDESC3094: "Large parts of $PROVINCENAME$ are already in the hands of rebel forces. Everywhere in the province, our troops are retreating and our supporters going into hiding; only the city of [Root.GetCapitalName] holds out. However, with the defection of a large group of the city's defenders, it is only a matter of time before the whole province falls."

 EVTNAME5051: "Unhappiness Among the Artisans"
 EVTDESC5051: "Conflicts and protests over taxes, corporations, trade and customs policies are becoming quite frequent and could result in a sharp drop in our industrial production if we don't handle the situation carefully."
 EVTOPTA5051: "Execute the troublemakers."
 EVTOPTB5051: "Abolish a tax."
 EVTNAME5052: "Unhappiness Among the Peasantry"
 EVTDESC5052: "Conflicts and protests over taxes, landlord cruelty, expropriation, serfdom and customs policies have become quite frequent. If we don't manage to solve the problems soon, the consequences for our nation's stability could be dire."
 EVTOPTA5052: "We rule as we see fit!"
 EVTOPTB5052: "Try to improve their situation."
 EVTNAME5053: "Unhappiness Among the Merchants."
 EVTDESC5053: "Conflict and protests over taxes, corporations, port duties, navy requisitions, trade and customs policies were quite frequent and often had counterproductive effects."
 EVTOPTA5053: "Reduce trade investment."
 EVTOPTB5053: "Get rid of the troublemakers."
 EVTNAME5054: "Political Crisis"
 EVTDESC5054: "Political crises may occur from time to time. They often involved a conflict between the ruler and the parliament, unrest among the nobility or conflicts of interest between the nobility and the merchants or religious leaders."
 EVTOPTA5054: "Given time, a solution will present itself."
 EVTOPTB5054: "Reputation isn't everything."
 EVTNAME5055: "Corruption"
 EVTDESC5055: "Corruption is one of the most common and frequent factors of political and economic life. Several scandals over the past year have brought the issue to the fore, so much so that many of our subjects are calling for us to take action against this growing problem. Failing to do so could have dire consequences for our ability to govern the realm."
 EVTOPTA5055: "Try to eradicate the problems."
 EVTOPTB5055: "Ignore them."
 EVTNAME5056: "Diplomatic Insult"
 EVTDESC5056: "A careless turn of phrase by [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has greatly offended the [insulted_party.GetAdjective] [insulted_party.Monarch.GetTitle]. Mollifying [insulted_party.Monarch.GetHerHim] will not be easy without losing face."
 EVTOPTA5056: "We won't forget this."
 EVTOPTB5056: "Try to ease the tension."
 EVTNAME5057: "Fortification Effort"
 EVTDESC5057: "A permanent matter of regal attention, fortification of the realm is an expensive but vital business. Claiming to be situated in a position of great strategic importance, our local authorities in [Root.GetName] are demanding funding for the renovation of the province's forts."
 EVTOPTA5057: "It's of the utmost importance."
 EVTOPTB5057: "It's too expensive."
 EVTNAME5058: "Nobles Demand Privileges"
 EVTDESC5058: "The privileges of the [Root.GetNobilityName] have been under continuous assault as $MONARCH$ has attempted to centralize more and more control. The nobles have finally lost their patience and are demanding that they are given back what they believe is rightfully theirs."
 EVTOPTA5058: "Accept their rightful claims."
 EVTOPTB5058: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTNAME5059: "Trading Company's bubble bursts"
 EVTDESC5059: "One of [Root.GetUsableName]'s largest trading companies has failed, wiping out large sums of wealth. As is so often the case, the company was founded on highly speculative stocks that were far less safe than many had been led to believe. As a result, confidence in the government is shaken."
 EVTOPTA5059: "Cut down on our expenses."
 EVTOPTB5059: "This isn't anything we can't handle."
 EVTNAME5061: "Saint Performs Miracle"
 EVTDESC5061: "Some people were so devout in their religion that they set out to help the poor and heal the sick. They were often called saints for their acts and were sometimes even believed to perform miracles."
 EVTOPTA5061: "We have truly been blessed."
 EVTOPTB5061: "Their actions have shown us the true path."
 EVTNAME5062: "Regulation of the Medical Profession"
 EVTDESC5062: "Our local authorities in [Root.GetName] have made joint cause with the province's intelligentsia to expand the number of doctors and midwives in the region. They have begun to pay greater attention to regulating and supervising the training of medical professionals at universities, hoping that this will help reduce the influence of superstition in the practice of medicine over time."
 EVTOPTA5062: "Our research will benefit population growth."
 EVTOPTB5062: "There is still room for improvement."
 EVTNAME5063: "Noble Families Feud"
 EVTDESC5063: "Violence among leading families within a state is never far from the surface. Recently, two noble families have quarrelled in [province_in_question.GetName], where the dispute has become so heated that the two parties seem set to raise arms against each other unless we can settle the issue."
 EVTOPTA5063: "Side with one family."
 EVTOPTB5063: "Let them fight it out."
 EVTOPTC5063: "Try to settle the issue."
 EVTNAME5064: "Nobles Ally with Foreign Power"
 EVTDESC5064: "The [Root.GetNobilityName] often prove unruly subjects of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], seeking to resist any infringement on their autonomy and seizing any opportunity to strengthen their position. This often includes making common cause with foreign powers. Recently, several key figures appear to have struck an agreement with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName] to advocate a pro-[neighbour_country.GetAdjective] course of action in return for certain favors and promises. While not directly treasonable, this behavior is clearly detrimental to our interests; however, reining them in is likely to prove no easy matter."
 EVTOPTA5064: "They will pay for their treachery."
 EVTOPTB5064: "We'll deal with them later."
 EVTNAME5065: "Assassination of Noble"
 EVTDESC5065: "The noble families are the bulwark of our power. However, they are not a united force and are locked in a constant struggle against each other for influence and power. As time marches on, some noble houses might see their fortunes rise while others could lose all their power, the resulting envy leading to bitter rivalries and recriminiations. Recently, one of these rivalries boiled over into outright conflict as [Root.assassinated_dude.GetName], the leader of a powerful noble house, was assassinated by his rivals. Furious, his surviving relatives are preparing their violent revenge..."
 EVTOPTA5065: "Let them solve it among themselves."
 EVTOPTB5065: "Take control of the situation."
 EVTNAME5066: "Cessation of Church Functions"
 EVTDESC5066: "Several members of the [Root.GetNobilityName] have come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] with a proposal. Desperate for more lands and titles, they look with envy towards the [Root.GetClergyName], who own considerable land. They ask that we transfer church land to them in return for a large cash contribution to the [Root.GetStateForm]'s efforts. Of course, in the long term, we'd lose out on tax revenues from church lands in return for this short-term boost in revenue."
 EVTOPTA5066: "Accept."
 EVTOPTB5066: "Decline."
 EVTNAME5068: "Sale of Offices"
 EVTDESC5068: "The crown often resorted to short term cash grabs like the sale of government offices. These sales would bring in a lot of revenue but in the long term, more officials meant more tax revenue siphoned off before it reached the royal treasury."
 EVTOPTA5068: "Accept"
 EVTOPTB5068: "Decline"
 EVTNAME5070: "Monopoly Company Formed"
 EVTDESC5070: "The realm often grants trading companies the exclusive rights to traffic goods in a region in exchange for a lump-sum payment and continuing revenues from the traders. We have just managed to negotiate one such agreement with a group of [Root.GetAdjective] entrepreneurs that promises to deliver us a lucrative windfall."
 EVTOPTA5070: "Make a long-term investment."
 EVTOPTB5070: "Demand payment in full!"
 EVTNAME5071: "Nobles Demand Increased Pensions"
 EVTDESC5071: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has to employ many methods to keep the unruly nobles in line. One of the most common is cold hard cash. We already grant the nobles a pension in exchange for relinquishing certain rights; however, their leaders now claim that we are not paying them enough and are demanding their pensions rise if they are to continue to support the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 EVTOPTA5071: "Accept their demands."
 EVTOPTB5071: "Refuse their demands."
 EVTNAME5072: "Grant Export Licenses"
 EVTDESC5072: "Instead of paying cash to the nobles, another option is to grant them privileges to collect special revenues, for example from foreign trade, from which they can make a healthy profit. A proposal has recently reached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s ears to grant several noble families export licenses for our trade with [neighbour_country.GetUsableName]. Doing so would please them greatly, but the commercial classes may view the matter less favorably..."
 EVTOPTA5072: "Grant privileges."
 EVTOPTB5072: "Privileges have to be earned."
 EVTNAME5073: "New Land Claimed"
 EVTDESC5073: "Our authorities in [Root.GetName] have managed to open up new land for our people by clearing a dense forest that previously made a large area of land inhospitable for settlement. These newly cleared areas will surely lead to a population boom there."
 EVTOPTA5073: "Increase Tax Income."
 EVTOPTB5073: "Increase Manpower."
 EVTOPTC5073: "Increase both for an additional cost."
 EVTNAME5074: "Establish Cantonments"
 EVTDESC5074: "The establishment of a permanent recruiting area for armies of the age has made it much easier for us to extract men from the population to serve in the army."
 EVTOPTA5074: "Draft citizens"
 EVTOPTB5074: "Mass draft with financial incentive"
 EVTNAME5075: "Nobles Demand Old Rights"
 EVTDESC5075: "The nobility still recall the days when the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] was just the first among many nobles. They yearn for a return to those days and are actively pressuring [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to restore to them certain lost rights and privileges."
 EVTOPTA5075: "Accept demands"
 EVTOPTB5075: "Reject demands"
 EVTNAME5076: "Cities Demand Old Rights"
 EVTDESC5076: "As we look to centralize the state, we inevitably infringe on the autonomy of the urban dwellers, who have always existed under a different code of rules than their rural brethren. The cities actively resist pressure to be brought under more uniform rules and regulations, and demand that their old rights be respected."
 EVTOPTA5076: "Deny them their old rights!"
 EVTOPTB5076: "Accept their demands."
 EVTNAME5077: "Non-enforcement of Ordinances"
 EVTDESC5077: "Although the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] issues many ordinances, [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] is in practice almost powerless to enforce them. Instead, enforcement depends upon the local powers - regional nobility and city governments - that are not always as vigilant as would be desired. Recently, it has come to our attention that our authorities in [troublesome_province.GetAreaName] are being particularly reticent in enforcing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s will."
 EVTOPTA5077: "Let them handle it."
 EVTOPTB5077: "Increase attempts!"
 EVTNAME5082: "The [Root.GetBurghersName] Request Privileges"
 EVTDESC5082: "The [Root.GetBurghersName] have grown increasingly resentful of the power of the noble families and particularly their lack of opportunities in the higher ranks of government. Their only route into power is to marry into poor but well-titled noble families, or to pry open positions in government circles by demanding greater privileges from the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]."
 EVTOPTA5082: "Grant them privileges."
 EVTOPTB5082: "Deny them privileges."
 EVTNAME5083: "Italian Engineer Available"
 EVTDESC5083: "A siege engineer from [italian_engineer_country.GetUsableName], [Root.italian_engineer.GetName], has arrived at our court, offering his services to the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]. He claims to be well-versed in the art of building the formidable Italian bastion fort, the trace italienne, which our military theorists have been desperate to emulate. However, his services will not come cheaply."
 EVTOPTA5083: "Hire him."
 EVTOPTB5083: "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5084: "Foreign Drill Instructor Available"
 EVTDESC5084: "The [drill_instructor_country.GetAdjective] drillmasters have become masters at the art of training troops to use firearms even more effectively. However, their methods are not a secret - far from it. In fact, entrepreneurial [drill_instructor_country.GetAdjective] veterans are now making a living for themselves by offering their knowledge to the rulers of all of Europe. One such drillmaster, [Root.dutch_drillmaster.GetName], has arrived at our court offering his services."
 EVTOPTA5084: "Hire him."
 EVTOPTB5084: "Decline the offer."
 EVTNAME5085: "Build a Great Palace"
 EVTDESC5085: "Monarchs often struggling to subdue the nobility and secure their standing in the eyes of their peers. The rise of firearms has reduced the nobles' role as warriors but left them with, in the eyes of the monarchs, too much idle time. In order to dazzle the nobles and keep them occupied, many monarchs are increasingly creating grand new palaces and introducing elaborate court rituals. [Root.GetUsableNameCap] is no different, and we have instructed our chief architect to draw up plans for a new palace to be built."
 EVTOPTA5085: "Build the palace."
 EVTOPTB5085: "Don't build it."
 EVTNAME5086: "Uncooperative Philosopher"
 EVTDESC5086: "The philosopher [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] has not shied back from expressing opinions contrary to those of both the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] and the Holy Church. [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHisCap] latest publishings appear to have been particularly provocative, so much so that the Church is demanding we hand [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] over to their inquisitors to be tried for heresy and "
 EVTOPTA5086: "Imprison $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$."
 EVTOPTB5086: "Allow $PHILOSOPHER_O_PRONOUN$ to remain free."
 EVTNAME5087: "Boundary Dispute"
 EVTDESC5087: "The lack of good maps or tools to create accurate maps has helped our cause in the border region of [claim_province.GetAreaName]. Our local authorities have been able to make use of certain ambiguities to make a convincing case that [claim_province.GetName] should in fact belong to [Root.Owner.GetUsableName], rather than to [claim_province.Owner.GetUsableName]. Should we press these claims, or would it be better to let them slide?"
 EVTOPTA5087: "Press the issue."
 EVTOPTB5087: "Settle the issue."
 EVTNAME5088: "Merchants harassed"
 EVTDESC5088: "Our merchants have long complained about the unfair treatment they have suffered in [harassing_merchants_nation.GetUsableName]. Recently, however, these complaints have escalated and the merchants now claim to be victims of [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] brigandage and privateering - attacks they insist were carried out with the tacit support of the [harassing_merchants_nation.GetAdjective] [harassing_merchants_nation.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]. We must find a solution to the issue, one way or another."
 EVTOPTA5088: "Escalate complaint."
 EVTOPTB5088: "Seek a diplomatic solution."
 EVTNAME5089: "Petition for Redress"
 EVTDESC5089: "One of the local [Root.GetNobilityName] in [uppity_peasants_province.GetName] has so upset and mistreated his subjects that a delegation of peasants has come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] to ask for redress. Agreeing to this would be popular with the peasantry but would be seen as an infringement on their authority by the [Root.GetNobilityName]."
 EVTOPTA5089: "Accept petition."
 EVTOPTB5089: "Deny petition."
 EVTNAME5090: "Noble Family Requests Aid"
 EVTDESC5090: "One of [Root.GetUsableName]'s most powerful noble families has, despite its vast landed wealth, managed to accumulate significant debts that it is finding hard to pay back. They have approached the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to ask for help, hoping that their distant kinship with the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family and their promises of undying support will sway [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim] to help them out in their time of need."
 EVTOPTA5090: "Grant aid."
 EVTOPTB5090: "Deny aid."
 EVTNAME5091: "Support for Dissidents Abroad"
 EVTDESC5091: "We have been contacted by a group of [dissidents_in_here.GetAdjective] dissidents who claim to have a vast network of support ready to force the [dissidents_in_here.GetAdjective] [dissidents_in_here.Monarch.GetTitle] to adopt a pro-[Root.GetAdjective] course if we can just provide them with some cash. Although they are most likely lying, their claims have excited many influential people at our court. Supporting these dissidents probably won't accomplish anything other than antagonizing [dissidents_in_here.GetUsableName] but turning them down could give a bad impression."
 EVTOPTA5091: "Support."
 EVTOPTB5091: "Decline."
 EVTNAME5092: "Foreign Trade Competition Rises"
 EVTDESC5092: "Foreign merchants are increasingly out-competing [Root.GetAdjective] traders in our ports, flooding our markets with cheap goods produced elsewhere. This is making it difficult for our traders to make a living. They have come before the [Root.GetRulerTitleOrRegency] to propose a new tariff on foreign goods, which would help protect them from competition from abroad."
 EVTOPTA5092: "Impose new tariff."
 EVTOPTB5092: "There shall be no new tariffs."
 EVTNAME5093: "Parliament Demands [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName]'s Removal"
 EVTDESC5093: "Citing several example of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] allegedly poor performance and bad judgment (but in fact motivated by [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] outspoken criticism of them), parliamentary leaders are demanding the removal of [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName] from office."
 EVTOPTA5093: "Fire [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim]!"
 EVTOPTB5093: "We have faith in [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim]."
 EVTNAME5094: "Heretic Advisor"
 EVTDESC5094: "The [Root.GetClergyName] are outraged that a heretic, our [Root.GetEventAdvisorTitle] [Root.GetEventAdvisorName], should be employed as an advisor to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. They demand [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHis] immediate removal!"
 EVTOPTA5094: "Fire [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim]!"
 EVTOPTB5094: "We have faith in [Root.GetEventAdvisorHerHim]."
 EVTNAME5095: "Statesman gains power"
 EVTDESC5095: "It seems that one of our advisors, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetName], will stop at nothing to elevate [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] position. Using more or less questionable methods, [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHe] has come to command the undivided attention of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], who is said to obey [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHis] every whim."
 EVTOPTA5095: "Fire [Root.Dip_Advisor.GetHerHim]!"
 EVTOPTB5095: "[Root.Dip_Advisor.GetSheHeCap] is doing a great job."
 EVTNAME5096: "Influenced Elections"
 EVTDESC5096: "Bribes and other incentives have never been an uncommon practice before an election. It's also well known that influential people, even in our own court, have resorted to such practices in hope of changing the outcome of the election in their favor."
 EVTOPTA5096: "How thoughtful."
 EVTOPTB5096: "Bribes are beyond me."
 EVTNAME5097: "Peasants Getting Uppity"
 EVTDESC5097: "Our efforts to keep the peasants in their place have been somewhat too successful in recent times. So harsh is our rule, in fact, that the destitute are becoming increasingly vocal in their complaints and are turning against their landlords, demanding better treatment and conditions."
 EVTOPTA5097: "Enforce serfdom."
 EVTOPTB5097: "These things happen."
 EVTNAME5098: "Corruption among the [Root.GetClergyName]"
 EVTDESC5098: "The [Root.GetClergyName] are meant to be incorruptible - after all, that is what they preach. However, it seems they do not always live up to their own teachings. A scandal has broken out surrounding several of their leading figures, who instead of providing our people with honest spiritual guidance appear to have made themselves obscenely rich through various dodgy dealings over a prolonged period of time."
 EVTOPTA5098: "Cleanse the temple."
 EVTOPTB5098: "Fine the sinners."
 EVTNAME5099: "Merchant Fractures"
 EVTDESC5099: "A dispute has broken out between several extremely wealthy - and therefore influential - merchants over [Root.GetAdjective] trade policy. One group favors taking a mercantilist approach, calling for the government to ensure that the wealth generated by trade within [Root.GetUsableName] goes mainly to [Root.GetAdjective] traders and producers. The other dismisses this protectionist approach as old-fashioned and is in favor of free trade, which they claim would liberate them to seek profits around the world. Naturally, both sides consider the other to be at best highly unreasonable, at worst dangerous in their misguided beliefs."
 EVTOPTA5099: "Support mercantilist faction."
 EVTOPTB5099: "This isn't a matter for the crown."
 EVTOPTC5099: "Free trade is the future."
 EVTNAME6000: "Naval Traditions Scorned"

 EVTNAME6009: "Road Constructions"
 EVTDESC6009: "The construction and maintenance of roads and trade routes in the northern areas of our country have had a great impact on our economy. It has allowed us to increase our trade and thereby generate a higher tax income."

 EVTOPTB6009: "Increased manpower."
 EVTNAME6010: "Conquistador"

 EVTNAME6013: "Grand Ball in $CAPITAL$"
 EVTDESC6013: "The nobility have developed a taste for glamorous balls, state-dinners and other extravagances to entertain themselves. Although rather expensive, they are an excellent opportunity to show off the grandeur of [Root.GetUsableName] and the generosity of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."

 EVTOPTA960: "We are ready for war!"
 EVTNAME7001: "Local Nobles Protesting"

 EVTNAME7005: "Our Union has a bad reputation"
 EVTDESC7005: "Our monarch, to put it politely, is not considered the best person to have as a neighbor. In fact the history of that nation is that of expansion and conquest. Tragically it seems we are being tarred with the same brush."

 EVTOPTB7005: "We are ONE!"
 EVTNAME4043: "Unprofitable Trade"

 EVTDESC6032: "The province of [claim_province.GetName] has been a disputed border region between us and [claim_province.Owner.GetUsableName] for quite some time, but there really shouldn't be any question about its loyalty, considering the religious ties between us and its local population.

 EVTDESC6337: "One of our provincial governors has figured out, that under our current decentralized policies he could go into business for himself. The fact that the army he has managed to raise is way too small to support such a claim doesn't seem to worry him much."
 EVTOPTA6337: "Give him the autonomy he wants."
 EVTNAME9000: "Japan Discovered!"
 EVTDESC9000: "$MONARCHTITLE$! Word has just reached us of new lands in the Far East. A string of islands known only as 'Japan' has been discovered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ships, and it seems we are the first to bring word of this wondrous place to Europe. We must hurry to take advantage of this discovery before other European nations do."
 EVTOPTA9000: "An Age of Wonders!"
 EVTNAME9004: "Christian Pater"
 EVTDESC9004: "A Christian Pater from Europe has washed up on our shores and wishes to begin preaching the word of his God in one of our provinces. The Christian Father petitions his majesty for permission to erect a steeple and begin educating our people in the ways of Jesus Christ."
 EVTOPTA9004: "I see no harm in that!"
 EVTOPTB9004: "I think we can do without strange new creeds."
 EVTNAME9006: "Christian Converts"
 EVTDESC9006: "A wave of religious conversion sweeps $PROVINCENAME$, as more and more locals flock to the congregation established there not too long ago by a Western Christian father. The people of the province convert en masse to the new creed."
 EVTOPTA9006: "We have little choice but to accept this change."
 EVTOPTB9006: "We will not tolerate this abandonment of tradition."
 EVTNAME9008: "Kirishitan Tensions"
 EVTDESC9008: "The local 'kirishitan' community in $PROVINCENAME$, which recently converted to the new European religion and its story of the crucified God, has found itself in conflict with a local Daimyo. The local tensions threaten to erupt into open revolt."
 EVTOPTA9008: "Blast!"
 EVTNAME9010: "Red Seal Ship Returns"
 EVTDESC9010: "The ship's tall mast stretches almost to the sky. Its sails are lowered now, but the ship lying low in the water speaks of a rich cargo. The Red Seal Ship has returned from a trading journey to the South Seas just today, bringing exotic goods from faraway lands."
 EVTOPTA9010: "Excellent! What can we learn from this?"
 EVTNAME9012: "Western Embassy Returns!"
 EVTDESC9012: "The Western Embassy that we dispatched to Europe some time ago has now returned with rich spoils. You receive the leader of the expedition in your study. What would you like to hear about the far off lands and peoples he has seen?"
 EVTOPTA9012: "Tell me more of their ideas!"
 EVTOPTB9012: "Tell me more of their people!"
 EVTNAME9014: "Fumi-e in $PROVINCENAME$"
 EVTDESC9014: "Fumi-e (literally 'stepping-on-pictures') were objects produced during the Edo period to reveal hidden Christians. The practice consisted of forcing suspected Christian to trample on Christian iconography to prove their 'innocence' with regards to secret Christian worship. A local daimyo has had success in combating the local Kirishitan community by applying this innovative method."
 EVTOPTA9014: "Interesting development."
 EVTNAME9016: "Tempura Introduced"
 EVTDESC9016: "A new delicacy has spread to one of our provinces where it has been given approval by local connoisseurs. The dish consists of battered and deep-fried vegetables and fish, and has become known as 'Tempura'. The dish has apparently been introduced by Portuguese missionaries!"
 EVTOPTA9016: "Let us make it a tradition!"
 EVTOPTB9016: "Let us sell it far and wide!"
 EVTNAME9018: "A Batch of Western Arquebuses"
 EVTDESC9018: "Traders in one of our provinces have brought in a party of Western Arquebuses for our armed forces. We could buy this state-of-the-art technology, but it will not be cheap, and the muskets will not last forever."
 EVTOPTA9018: "Naturally we want the weapons."
 EVTOPTB9018: "The old ways are better."
 EVTNAME9020: "Kabuki Theater"
 EVTDESC9020: "A play in the new Kabuki style of drama has been performed in $CAPITAL$, and we are set to gain. The performers are excellent, and one of them could potentially become a highly productive court playwright. On the other hand, having this troupe out on the road is bound to improve our standing in the eyes of others."
 EVTOPTA9020: "Send them far afield!"
 EVTOPTB9020: "This man is needed in the court!"
 EVTNAME9022: "Ronin Offers His Service"
 EVTDESC9022: "A 'Ronin', a masterless Samurai, has offered his services at our court. The man is young, and his talents are not yet fully developed. We could either give the man a chance to develop these talents, or send him off to less prestigious posts."
 EVTOPTA9022: "His talents will blossom at our court!"
 EVTOPTB9022: "We do have a garrison somewhere in need of a captain."
 EVTOPTC9022: "We have no need of brigands and wayfarers."
 EVTNAME9024: "Nogaku Performance"
 EVTDESC9024: "The Noh, or Nogaku, is a traditional Japanese form of musical drama, and the performance tonight of a newly written piece at our court in $CAPITAL$ has been hailed as the most beautiful play in several years."
 EVTOPTA9024: "Make it a part of our cultural heritage!"
 EVTOPTB9024: "We are truly a patron of the arts."
 EVTNAME9026: "Karesansui Garden"
 EVTDESC9026: "One of your retainers has suggested that we build a 'Karesansui' (dry landscape) garden at a palace in one of our provinces. An impressive rock garden could be a cultural beacon for our clan for years to come, but, of course, there are costs associated with planning and building one."
 EVTOPTA9026: "Of course we must have one!"
 EVTOPTB9026: "I do not think that this is the time."
 EVTNAME9028: "Loyal Samurai"
 EVTDESC9028: "Several of the Samurai in our service have served us long and faithfully. Tradition dictates that this caste of our most loyal warriors must be rewarded by their master for their service. Our people expect us to reward these Samurai, and not doing so will mean destabilizing our realm."
 EVTOPTA9028: "Naturally we shall reward them!"
 EVTOPTB9028: "We have nothing to spare at the moment."
 EVTNAME9030: "Traveling Monk"
 EVTDESC9030: "The heavens have opened themselves and the rain outside falls a rattling tattoo on far off rooftops. A traveling monk has arrived at our doorsteps in $CAPITAL$, asking for food and lodgings. The monk has given a vow of poverty, and by tradition we are obliged to aid him."
 EVTOPTA9030: "Naturally we shall aid this traveler!"
 EVTOPTB9030: "Off with you, beggar!"
 EVTNAME9032: "Visiting a Shrine"
 EVTDESC9032: "It has been a long time since last we visited the principal shrines of one of our provinces. The Shrine is located off the beaten track, on top of a mountain said to be the abode of a very powerful kami. Normally we've gone there at least once every year, but it has been a while now. The attendants are expecting us, should we go visit the shrine?"
 EVTOPTA9032: "No, not this year. We must work on our Han!"
 EVTOPTB9032: "Yes, it is time"
 EVTNAME9034: "Cherry Blossom Festival"
 EVTDESC9034: "The season of the Cherry Blossoms is upon us! In every province of our Domain our people congregate at shrines and altars to pray, eat and enjoy the beauty of the season. Paper lanterns cast a warm nightly glow over our Han as we go to enjoy the festivities."
 EVTOPTA9034: "A proof of our good policies these last years"
 EVTOPTB9034: "An omen of good things to come!"
 EVTNAME9036: "1000 Koku Tax"
 EVTDESC9036: "One of the personal domains under our rulership still owes us outstanding taxes to the tune of 1000 koku of rice. Through communications with our tax collectors, the debtor has argued that his domain is overvalued and that he cannot afford to pay the taxes. We could forgive all or a part of the debt, but we could use the money."
 EVTOPTA9036: "We insist that he pay!"
 EVTOPTB9036: "We shall forgive part of the debt."
 EVTOPTC9036: "Forget the money."
 EVTNAME9038: "Death of a Geisha"
 EVTDESC9038: "The Geisha is the archetypal, female, Japanese entertainer, and in the last year one of the most well-known and well-liked Geishas in our domain died young after a short time of illness. The funeral has turned into a national day of sorrow as our Han mourns the passing of this beloved example of beauty."
 EVTOPTA9038: "We mourn her passing."
 EVTOPTB9038: "A dead courtesan? I can't be bothered."
 EVTNAME9040: "The Sharpness of The Tanto"
 EVTDESC9040: "Disgrace! $MONARCHTITLE$, our Han is in a state of collapse, and the name of our family is quickly becoming a Japanese byword for failure and disgrace. While no one has dared suggest it to your face, the precedents of the ancestors are clear. Either we manage to turn the situation around quickly, or we should consider Seppuku, ritual suicide. The blade of the Tanto gleams sharp and cold on your nightstand."
 EVTOPTA9040: "Compose a beautiful death poem."
 EVTOPTB9040: "We just need some more time."
 EVTNAME9042: "Unruly Daimyo"
 EVTDESC9042: "Several local Daimyo swearing fealty to our realm have been conspiring against us for some time. The reason for these conspiracies among our own seems to be that many consider our rule to be illegitimate. The unruly Daimyo demand that we divest more power to them, or face an open rebellion."
 EVTOPTA9042: "Accept their demands."
 EVTOPTB9042: "Hang them high."
 EVTNAME9044: "Koku Reform"
 EVTDESC9044: "The wealth of our lands is measured in 'Koku', with one Koku being the volume of rice required to feed one person for a year. While this is fairly easy to measure as such, several of the Provinces within our Domain have been consistently misvalued, since the Koku records have not been updated for several years. The outdated records, used among other things for tax collections, are becoming a source of growing discontent within our realm."
 EVTOPTA9044: "Appoint a special commissioner."
 EVTOPTB9044: "Order provinces to submit updated records."
 EVTNAME9046: "Rangaku Books"
 EVTDESC9046: "A European trader trafficking the waters around Japan has landed in our Han and offered to sell us a collection of treatises on western medicine, politics and astronomy. Buying these books would doubtless mean a shift in policy with regard to our Han's openness to trade, and such subversive tomes could destabilize the realm. Not buying the books might be a missed opportunity, but it will on the other hand force us to learn and discover for ourselves."
 EVTOPTA9046: "Sold!"
 EVTOPTB9046: "Just window-shopping, thank you!"
 EVTNAME9050: "Rice Crop Fails"
 EVTDESC9050: "The rice planted a few months ago has not come out of the ground, and the rice pads lie dead and dormant. Without rice to harvest, our people, especially the poorest among them, are facing famine and starvation. Amending this failed harvest will cost us, but the alternative might be worse."
 EVTOPTA9050: "We have nothing to spare!"
 EVTOPTB9050: "We must avert this catastrophe!"
 EVTNAME11000: "Eunuch Offers His Service"
 EVTDESC11000: "A Eunuch who claims to hail from a northern border province has offered his services to the Imperial Court. The man is clearly of some talent, and can most likely be a boon to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ administration. However, accepting the aid of this man of statecraft will strengthen the Eunuch faction at court."
 EVTOPTA11000: "Of course we are interested!"
 china_events.1.t: "Trade Regulations"
 china_events.1.d: "It seems the local officials of the Maritime Trade Office in [trade_problems_province.GetName] has taken it upon themselves to stimulate local commerce. A series of regulations issued have, while quite contrary to official policy, managed to provoke a local trade boom, with many local families getting into lucrative business while also attracting foreign merchants from overseas. The Grand Secretary is, however, imploring us to shut them down and retract the local stipulations as they are an affront to good governance and central power."
 china_events.1.a: "I am sure the people of [trade_problems_province.GetName] best know how to rule themselves."
 china_events.1.b: "We cannot let this slip past us!"
 china_events.2.t: "Incident in [port_incident_location.GetName]"
 china_events.2.d: "As merchants from every corner of the world seek out the rich ports of the Middle Kingdom it is no wonder that some will at times encounter groups they consider to be their enemies. Local officials are puzzled by a number of of disturbances in [port_incident_location.GetName] that seem related to two such competing groups trying to establish themselves in the same region.\nFearing that the unrest will spread our Commanderies are suggesting that we close down the ports and remove any foreigners in the area. The local offices of Maritime Trade, however, instead recommend that we fine both sides but allow them to continue purchasing our goods."
 china_events.2.a: "Fine them but allow them to continue."
 china_events.2.b: "Close down the office and expel the foreigners."
 china_events.3.t: "The Isolation of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 china_events.3.d: "By employing a tactic of constantly tailing the Emperor and building trust with him at every opportunity, court factions have managed to outmaneuver several previously influential courtiers and are increasingly gaining influence over the day to day palatial rulings."
 china_events.3.a: "[Root.Monarch.GetName] is clearly getting good advice."
 china_events.3.b: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] takes advice from no one!"
 china_events.4.t: "A Grand Burial"
 china_events.4.d: "A powerful minister at the Imperial Court has died due to old age. The death of this eminence has left a vacuum that the other factions are now seeking to fill. However, his passing goes beyond petty court politics. It is a profound loss for the empire and we are expected to provide the man with a stately funeral as a token of our appreciation."
 china_events.4.a: "The state has no money to spend."
 china_events.4.b: "He deserves nothing less than a grand ceremony."
 china_events.5.t: "Yellow River Dikes"
 china_events.5.d: "Preparing for the seasonal flooding of the Yellow river is one of the oldest and most important duties of any state in Northern China. Our officials have identified an area that has suffered in particular during the last few years. It would blossom if we could only stop the water from threatening the livelihood of the locals."
 china_events.5.a: "This will surely please the officials!"
 china_events.5.b: "Alas we have no money to spare."
 china_events.6.t: "A Gift"
 china_events.6.d: "One of our most respected courtiers has presented us with an expensive gift in the form of an enormous and carefully constructed countryside manor. Though nothing compared to the Imperial treasury, the gift is quite grand and it is clear to any observer that the doner must be expecting to get something in return..."
 china_events.6.a: "We must accept this offering!"
 china_events.6.b: "We cannot risk our reputation."
 china_events.7.t: "Destitute Banknotes"
 china_events.7.d: "As more and more unbacked notes are being issued by the Imperial government our Offices of Trade are fearing that inflation will soon be a growing problem in the [Root.GetAdjective] Empire and in the provinces the people have started talking about this being a sign of us losing the Mandate of Heaven.\nA representative arrived at court today proposing a scheme to reinvigorate the imperial economy by means of a temporary tax combined with reforms to the treasury."
 china_events.7.a: "This all sounds very interesting!"
 china_events.7.b: "We cannot appear this weak, we must act!"
 china_events.7.c: "I have trust in the Grand Secretariat."
 china_events.8.t: "Quick-Fingered Treasurer"
 china_events.8.d: "Money has been mysteriously disappearing from the Imperial treasury for some time now, and you have started to direct your suspicions to a court official employed as a treasury book keeper."
 china_events.8.a: "Execute him!"
 china_events.8.b: "Best to keep quiet about this."
 china_events.9.t: "Optimus Excels at Examinations"
 china_events.9.d: "A young man has excelled at this year's Imperial Examinations. With the highest total score he was not only the optimus of his year, even the examiners have been inspired by the elegant essay in a style will likely set the tone of the examinations for years to come."
 china_events.9.a: "This man must be granted a place in court!"
 china_events.9.b: "I'm sure he can find work in the provinces."
 china_events.10.t: "The Eunuch's Vice"
 china_events.10.d: "An influential proponent of the military at court has harbored a dark secret. For some time, the courtier in question has been under the influence of an ever worsening and consuming opium addiction. Despite flagrant rumors circulating this Eunuch insists that the matter be kept under a lid. He promises that he will try to reform his ways, and to try to practice moderation in the future."
 china_events.10.a: "I suppose we can overlook this."
 china_events.10.b: "It would be cheaper to fire him."
 china_events.11.t: "The Examinations of $YEAR$"
 china_events.11.d: "Pupils and Examinees have outperformed themselves and most everyone else at this year's Imperial Examination. The successes at the examinations promises good things for the secretariat, and for the empire at large. In fact it has been suggested that given the excellent results the official quota for how many can pass is on the low side. The Grand Secretary has approached the Emperor asking for a second round of out-takes to allow more of this gifted generation to join the cadres."
 china_events.11.a: "Only the best are good enough."
 china_events.11.b: "We can certainly use more loyal administrators."
 china_events.12.t: "The Southern Elites"
 china_events.12.d: "For centuries the southern Empire has been richer and more populous than the north. It is in the south that many of the richest and most influential families have their roots, and it is in the south that the vast majority of the highest scoring in the Imperial Examinations are selected.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that the southern families have an undue influence due to the many southerners in the Palatial administration. In the past quotas have been used to ensure that some part of those who pass the examinations originate from the north. Such quotas would, however, risk to undermine our entire system of merit as the guiding principle."
 china_events.12.a: "We need better quotas!"
 china_events.12.b: "Northern Literati just don't compare to southerners..."
 china_events.13.t: "The [levy_province.GetName] Levy"
 china_events.13.d: "Officials have undertaken a project to expand the levy in [levy_province.GetName] by improving and updating the local censuses. The reform promises to bring additional manpower to the Imperial Army, and improve the province's future troop recruitment. Confucian administrators, however, would argue that leaving the locals alone would likely increase the value of the province more long term."
 china_events.13.a: "Naturally these reforms are called for."
 china_events.13.b: "No need to harass the peasantry."
 china_events.14.t: "Field Marshal Dishonored"
 china_events.14.d: "One of our Field Marshals has been caught red-handed siphoning off funds intended for our defenses. He is a disgrace to his family and for himself. This his ill conceived deed has severely hurt the defensive capabilities of the forts in [corrupt_fort.GetName] and [corrupt_fort2.GetName], causing the Empire of China to appear weak."
 china_events.14.a: "Execute him!"
 china_events.14.b: "Forgive him so that he can help amend this problem."
 china_events.15.t: "Heir Lends an Ear"
 china_events.15.d: "We have noticed that the heir apparent has grown closer to certain courtiers and officials who are known affiliates of the competing factions at court. There's a great fear that [Root.Heir.GetName] has come to strongly sympathize with political enemies of the imperial throne. We could attempt to stop these friendships from growing, but having powerful friends in court can be a good thing for our [Root.Heir.GetHerHim] when he assumes the throne."
 china_events.15.a: "[Root.Heir.GetName] should align with the Secretariat."
 china_events.15.b: "[Root.Heir.GetName] should align with the Commanderis."
 china_events.15.c: "[Root.Heir.GetName] should align with the Trade Offices."
 china_events.15.e: "[Root.Heir.GetName] must stay aloof of court politics."
 china_events.15.f: "[Root.Heir.GetName] must find [Root.Heir.GetHerHis] own way."
 china_events.16.t: "'If people have enough, can the ruler have too little?'"
 china_events.16.d: "Word has reached you that a truly exceptional essay has passed through the examination system in one of your provinces. It argues convincingly and in excellent literary style that it is folly to expect a country to be rich from increasing taxes. Our examiners describe this text as 'profoundly crafted' and there is no doubt that it will give rise to a new style for examination essays for years to come.\nThe meat of the essay itself, however, cannot be ignored. The argument that avoiding high taxes makes the people as a whole richer and therefore the empire itself richer is a classical wisdom it is easy to overlook."
 china_events.16.a: "I sense a great future for this man."
 china_events.16.b: "We must stay clear of such dangerous Mencian Influence!"
 china_events.17.t: "Literati Publishes"
 china_events.17.d: "A Confucian scholar employed in the palatial administration has assembled a collection of essays that has quickly gained popularity both among officials and those training to one day take the examinations."
 china_events.17.a: "He is a credit to the Empire."
 china_events.17.b: "We cannot give him official recognition for this work."
 china_events.18.t: "Retainer Flogged"
 china_events.18.d: "A high ranking official has earned himself a reputation for cruelty since taking to regularly flogging a particular retainer of his, of whom he seems to have a particular distaste. While he is fully within his rights to punish his lessers, this has caused something of a scandal and people generally feel that his treatment could benefit from a little moderation."
 china_events.18.a: "He's setting an excellent example!"
 china_events.18.b: "Relieve the Official."
 china_events.19.t: "Drama on the River"
 china_events.19.d: "A Pearl River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from the southern provinces, has been boarded and seized by criminals. The official responsible for maintaining security has reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown and is now locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
 china_events.19.da: "A River tax barge, containing a significant share of this year's taxes from many of our provinces, has been boarded and seized by criminals. The official responsible for maintaining security has reportedly suffered a nervous breakdown after hearing about the incident and is reportedly locked up in his bedchamber, refusing to come out."
 china_events.19.a: "I guess we can kiss those taxes goodbye."
 china_events.19.b: "Levy extra taxes to remedy the situation."
 china_events.20.t: "Gold Mine Discovered"
 china_events.20.d: "A gold mine has been discovered in one of our provinces by a young official. Exploiting this new and rich lode may seem like a foregone conclusion, but some warn against the venture, citing concerns over a potential overextension of the money supply."
 china_events.20.a: "Dig deep and greedily!"
 china_events.20.b: "Let sleeping dogs lie."
 china_events.21.t: "Bullion Leaves the Country"
 china_events.21.d: "It has been discovered that large amounts of silver bullion have left the country on the various trade barges. Palatial bureaucrats are in animated discussions about how this has come to be. Accusations are being thrown around against local and central officials alike. The only agreement of the day seems to be that the exodus of wealth must be stopped."
 china_events.21.a: "Blame the local officials."
 china_events.21.b: "Renew efforts to import bullion."
 china_events.22.t: "Renovating a Pagoda"
 china_events.22.d: "A Tang dynasty pagoda in one of our provinces has fallen into disrepair after several years of neglected maintenance. A local official has now requested funds to restore the pagoda."
 china_events.22.a: "Naturally we shall restore it."
 china_events.22.b: "We have no time for such nonsense."
 china_events.23.t: "Frontier Hero"
 china_events.23.d: "Word has reached us from the frontier provinces of a young general, a brother to [Root.Consort.GetName] who has made a name for himself as an excellent warrior and a great leader. Due to his influence together with that of [Root.Consort.GetName] the [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName] family has grown ever more influential at court.\nDespite [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] great love for [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consort [Root.Monarch.GetName] is growing more and more fearful of the influence of the house of [Root.Consort.Dynasty.GetName]."
 china_events.23.da: "Word has reached us from the frontier provinces of a young general from one of our most influential families. The young man has made a name for himself as an excellent warrior and a great leader. His success has also made his family grow ever more influential at court.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] is growing more and more fearful of their influence in court politics."
 china_events.23.a: "Charge the General with Corruption."
 china_events.23.b: "We must replace him and distance ourselves from that family."
 china_events.23.c: "We cannot touch this hero of the people!"
 china_events.24.t: "'Students by Purchase'"
 china_events.24.d: "Many would give much to be able to attend our prestigious national schools. To some rich families, this would be a way to ensure that their children acquire the social status that their wealth should entitle them to. It has therefore been the custom to, in times of need, reserve a number of spots at the schools for those that can pay.\nMost will never take advantage of the actual opportunity to study, however, as admission in itself is enough to secure higher social standing."
 china_events.24.a: "Just a few additional reserved spots can surely do no harm?"
 china_events.24.b: "We must not risk the quality of our bureaucrats!"
 china_events.25.t: "Rogue Diplomacy"
 china_events.25.d: "Officials from the Offices of Maritime Trade have been very active in foreign diplomacy lately. [country_of_interest.GetName] in particular occupies the faction's attention. They believe opening up more channels for trade and cooperation would be beneficial for both of our countries. Some would rather argue that [country_of_interest.GetName] should submit to the authority of The Middle Kingdom.\nThe foreign ambassador has been summoned to the imperial palace. What shall we tell him?"
 china_events.25.a: "That he may go in peace."
 china_events.25.b: "That he best prepare his defenses."
 china_events.26.t: "The Favor of [Root.Monarch.GetName]"
 china_events.26.d: "Court officials are worried that [Root.Monarch.GetName] is being unduly influenced by [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] consorts. As members of prominent families of the realm they all have an interest in the power that comes from being near [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] Imperial majesty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetHerselfHimself], however, see no risk in this, it is merely natural that everyone seek the favor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 china_events.26.a: "Let us favor the [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] of a Viceroy."
 china_events.26.b: "The [Root.Consort.GetSisterBrother] of our marshal is the most favored consort."
 china_events.26.c: "Prefer the Grand [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] of the grand Secretary."
 china_events.26.dd: "The court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] is truly the center of the Empire."
 china_events.27.t: "Imperial Insults"
 china_events.27.d: "Today the reception of foreign dignitaries and potentates to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ court, has caused a diplomatic blunder. Contrary to protocol a foreign diplomat failed to perform the customary bow before our representatives. This major loss of face has quickly developed into a scandal and threatens to hurt our relations with [country_of_interest.GetName] for some time to come. The ambassador is now offering us valuable gifts to forget the affair."
 china_events.27.a: "Accept the gifts."
 china_events.27.b: "Refuse to deal with their ambassador again."
 china_events.28.t: "Inspecting The Banners"
 china_events.28.d: "The armies have amassed on the exercise field for the Grand Army Inspection of $YEAR$. Everywhere you look there is a forest of spears and swords, aiming in defiance at the heavens above. Several powerful generals and marshals are present. Over the past few years these men have done everything in their power to strengthen the army.\nThe safety of the Middle Kingdom depends on these troops, but it is not unheard of for a strong General to covet the Imperial throne himself..."
 china_events.28.a: "Commend the generals for their work"
 china_events.28.b: "It is time we weakened the armed forces."
 china_events.29.t: "Failures of the Examination System"
 china_events.29.d: "As the yearly examinations are corrected once again only a few thousands of the millions that participate will pass. This elite of experienced Confucian students will join the administration to rule the Empire of China in accordance with the classical ideals.\nThe many that fail, however, have to find work elsewhere. Far from illiterate they are still carriers of the classical ideals and education that the examinations require. These are the doctors, teachers and scribes of the empire. Some might say they are as valuable as the erudite few who join the cadres in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]"
 china_events.29.a: "Everything has beauty, but not everyone sees it."
 china_events.29.b: "All good and well but perhaps we should expand the quota for next year?"
 china_events.30.t: "Examining the Examinations"
 china_events.30.d: "There are those who feel the Imperial Examiners are not in tune with what is good and proper essay-writing and that the ideal they promote is stale and old fashioned. Among those studying for the exams alternative collections of examination essays have begun circulating of what is considered a more modern form. The examiners, however, are determined to keep promoting good taste and proper form.\nBy supporting the renewal faction we would bring a generation of new thinkers to the fore. This would likely come at the cost of the goodwill and loyalty of the old generation..."
 china_events.30.a: "Learning without thought is labor lost, thought without learning is perilous."
 china_events.30.a.tt: "Act to ensure the continuity of the existing system and the preferences of the Examiners."
 china_events.30.b: "Real knowledge is to know the extent of one's ignorance."
 china_events.30.b.tt: "Some might see this clear break with the old as unfitting for the [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] of Heaven."
 china_events.31.t: "The fall of [From.From.GetName]"
 china_events.31.d: "[From.From.GetName] has fallen and the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty is now believed to be the new holders of the Mandate of Heaven. We are expected to pick up the mantle of the Emperor and bring the Chinese people into a new era of prosperity and stability.\nIf we want to win over the remaining supporters of [From.From.GetName] rule we must start to build our own Imperial bureaucracy and invest in a strong and durable state. On the other hand [Root.Monarch.GetName] worries that disloyal officials will remain within any organization we inherit from [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] predecessors."
 china_events.31.a: "We must be merciful if we are to build something lasting."
 china_events.31.b: "Purge any remaining loyalists!"
 china_events.31.c: "The Imperial treasury needs to be filled first."
 china_events.32.t: "History of the [From.From.GetName] Empire"
 china_events.32.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your reign has ushered in a new era and as the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] complete their take-over China will undoubtedly prosper for many years to come. Perhaps the time has come to look back to the [From.From.GetName] empire and start the compilation of their history. Compiling a the fortunes of China during their entire reign would cost a fair bit of money and take many bureaucrats quite some time, but the benefits might outweigh the costs."
 china_events.32.da: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle], your reign has ushered in a new era and China will undoubtedly prosper for many years to come. Perhaps the time has come to look back to the past days of the [Root.GetName] empire and start the compilation of our history. Compiling a the fortunes of China during the entire reign would cost a fair bit of money and take many bureaucrats quite some time, but the benefits might outweigh the costs."
 china_events.32.a: "Time is of the essence!"
 china_events.32.b: "A thorough work for a solid rule."
 china_events.34.t: "The Four Treasures of the Scholar's Studio"
 china_events.34.d: "Use of brush, ink, inkstone and paper and the art of calligraphy is expected of every gentleman in high society. Mastering the cursive, xingshu, caoshu or zhuanshu forms, however, is a rare sign of brilliance. In our chancellery [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] is known to be an expert calligraphist, producing great works for the glory of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] dynasty.\n[Root.Monarch.GetName] has lately taken a great interest in this art, studying the work of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetTitle] in detail, impressed by the beauty and elegant work. It has therefore come as a great shock when a lesser official confessed that the allegory of the lauded works of [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetName] have frequently been veiled criticism of Royal Power."
 china_events.34.a: "Death awaits [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim]."
 china_events.34.b: "Killing [Root.Adm_Advisor.GetHerHim] would be a greater crime."
 china_events.35.t: "Protecting the Frontier"
 china_events.35.d: "A strong army has always been required to secure the borders of the Middle Kingdom. In times of weakness the savages in the regions outside of our reach have never hesitated to raid or even invade our lands.\nTo ensure our safety the commanderies are asking to send expeditions into the frontier regions, probing the strength of the Barbarians while also demonstrating our might."
 china_events.35.a: "An excellent idea!"
 china_events.35.b: "We must strengthen our defenses instead."
 china_events.36.t: "Jin Era Statuette"
 china_events.36.d: "A rare statuette from the Jin era has been discovered during renovations of an old temple. The idea has crossed your mind that it might be clever to bestow the statuette upon a worthy subject to strengthen his loyalty to you, The Emperor. Loyalties will doubtlessly change on account of such an impressive gift delivered directly from the Emperor's own hand. Who shall we give it to?"
 china_events.36.a: "The Grand Historian."
 china_events.36.b: "The Most Influential Family."
 china_events.36.c: "The Grand Marshal."
 china_events.37.t: "The Classic of Music"
 china_events.37.d: "Apart from the five classic texts compiled by Confucius, tradition also speaks of a sixth Classic"

 china_events.37.a: "The Province Governor."
 china_events.37.b: "A Local Literati."
 china_events.37.c: "The Empire of China is in good hands."
 china_events.38.t: "Cheating at Examinations"
 china_events.38.d: "Several examinees have been caught cheating at the Imperial Examinations this year. Instead of the prescribed three day solitude, the examinees have had ready access to the outside world. The cheating appears systematic and supported by corrupt examinators."
 china_events.38.a: "We must deal forcefully with the Examinators."
 china_events.38.b: "We must tolerate this for now."
 china_events.39.t: "Withdrawing Excess Paper"
 china_events.39.d: "There is general consensus within the Imperial Court that the amount of fiduciary media in circulation is much too great. Money must be recalled in order for inflation to recede from its current level, but the question is how much money should be rebought."
 china_events.39.a: "As much as we can afford."
 china_events.39.b: "As much as it takes."
 china_events.40.t: "Honoring the Ancestors"
 china_events.40.d: "The teachings of Confucius stress the importance of understanding and respecting the 'Five Relationships' that weave the web of society, and one of the most important relationships is that between father and son. Those who have gone before us deserve our thanksgiving, and it has been long enough since last we made an offering. Various courtiers have suggested sacrifices that your Majesty could perform. What seems most appropriate to present as an offering to honor the ancestors?"
 china_events.40.a: "Red meat, to keep them fed."
 china_events.40.b: "Candles, to light their way."
 china_events.40.c: "Spirit money, to pay their dues."
 china_events.41.t: "Bad Feng Shui"
 china_events.41.d: "Feng Shui is a system of both aesthetics and 'magic' believed by many to control the flow of the primary energy, the 'Qi', by relying on the laws of Heaven and Earth which guide it. The system is applied to tombs, homes and building, to ensure that the energy that courses through them is optimal. One of the court's most respected diviners and interpreters of the ebb and flow of The Qi has recently discovered that a newly built Imperial Ceremony House reeks with negative Qi!"
 china_events.41.a: "The diviner himself is clearly gone mad."
 china_events.41.b: "The builder did not consult the diviners."
 china_events.41.c: "Whoever put me up to building it must be blamed."
 china_events.41.dd: "They are mistaken, the building must be put to use."
 china_events.41.e: "Whoever put me up to building it must be blamed."
 china_events.42.t: "Court Bickering"
 china_events.42.d: "One of your Marshals has been insulted by a high ranking official of the Grand Secretariat. Apparently the men have had a hard time getting along for quite some time, and the insult was probably not entirely unprovoked. Nevertheless, the matter has become a pivot point of factional politics at the court, and it might be wise if the Emperor himself gave some input on the issue."
 china_events.42.a: "Relieve the Marshal of his duties."
 china_events.42.b: "Relieve the Secretary of his duties."
 china_events.42.c: "Denounce both for wasting the time of the Imperial Court."
 china_events.43.t: "A capital for the [Root.GetName] Empire"
 china_events.43.d: "As befits a new ruler of China it is now time to select the new seat of our dynasty. The location of our capital is likely to influence [Root.GetName] politics for years to come."
 china_events.43.a: "A [Root.Monarch.GetDaughterSon] of heaven must guard the northern frontier."
 china_events.43.b: "The city of the Golden Hills!"
 china_events.43.c: "The Ancient City of Eternal Peace."
 china_events.43.e: "Along the Lou River in Luoyang."
 china_events.43.f: "Let us remain in the seat of our ancestors at [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName]."
 china_events.45.t: "Rise of Millenarianism"
 china_events.45.d: "Our weakening grip over the empire and the increasingly popular notion that we are losing the Mandate of Heaven has given rise to a variety of Millenarian movements around the country. Remembering the last days of Yuan rule our officials are categorizing these sects as members of the 'White Lotus' society but in truth it seems there is a great disparity in their motivations.\nWhat they do have in common, however, is the goal of disruption chaos and the overthrowing of our established and perceived oppressive rule."
 china_events.45.a: "What can they do against the might of the Empire?"
 china_events.45.b: "We must act decisively to stomp this out!"
 china_events.46.t: "Floods"
 china_events.46.d: "The Seasonal rains have hit us unusually hard this year. As the Yellow River levees break and homes are washed away the sky itself seems to be weeping for our dynasty. In the provinces rumors have begun to circulate that this catastrophe is a sign of the loss of the Mandate of Heaven and the iminent collapse of the [Root.Country.GetName] Empire."
 china_events.46.a: "It is our duty to restore what we can."
 china_events.46.b: "We can clearly no longer protect these people."
 china_events.47.t: "Brigands on the Silk Road"
 china_events.47.d: "With The Mandate of Heaven seemingly not in our favor, things have quickly gone from bad to worse in several provinces across the country, where brigands and highwaymen are becoming ever more of a problem. The problem has been particularly noticeable along what remains of the old Silk Road."
 china_events.47.a: "The Military must handle this."
 china_events.47.b: "Let them fend for themselves."
 china_events.48.t: "The Shadow that Stalks the Corridor"
 china_events.48.d: "As you walk through the long corridors of the Palace, you suddenly have a distinct sense of being followed. In the corner of your eye a white-clad man approaches you from behind. You cannot see the dagger, gleaming with malice, but you know it is there, behind you, a mere few yards from your heart.\nAs you turn around the man is suddenly gone without a trace. It is as if he was never there..."
 china_events.48.a: "Enemies are everywhere!"
 china_events.48.b: "Surely I can trust everyone here, I just need to rest."
 china_events.49.t: "Portentous Solar Eclipse"
 china_events.49.d: "You can only stare in awe as the glowing white of the sun disappears behind the black disc suspended in the sky, and the world turns to darkness despite it being mid day. A few minutes later the disc has passed by the sun, and light returns. You are shaken by the experience, but many of your subjects are absolutely terrified. Some whisper that the eclipse proves that Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty. What should we make of this situation?"
 china_events.49.a: "Execute and blame the court astrologer."
 china_events.49.b: "Prohibit all discussion of the topic."
 china_events.50.t: "Disloyal Officials"
 china_events.50.d: "The Imperial Examination system is excellent for turning out well educated and thoroughly competent bureaucrats and officials, ready to face the various challenges of day to day rule and administration that the Empire of China possess.\nThat same education is, however, now making our administrators very weary of some of the measures we have been taking recently. Believing the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] family to be acting without a heavenly Mandate has made many officials unwilling to comply with our demand. At times it would seem Imperial authority doesn't stretch further than one can see from the palace walls."
 china_events.50.a: "We must purge such heresy!"
 china_events.50.b: "In time we will earn their trust again."
 china_events.51.t: "Lacking Authority"
 china_events.51.d: "It is becoming more and more apparent that the power of the [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] is waning and that the Imperial center is unable to rule the Middle Kingdom, much less maintain any kind of authority over the outer states.\nWith the refusal of the [unruly_subject.GetAdjective] to kowtow before what they believe to be an illegitimate emperor it seems our influence beyond our borders has deteriorated sharply."
 china_events.51.a: "Fear will keep them in line!"
 china_events.52.t: "Plague Strikes The Court"
 china_events.52.d: "Plagues, famines, droughts and calamities are becoming increasingly frequent in $COUNTRY$ these days, and now a particularly nasty disease has arrived at court. Yesterday morning a Bureaucrat employed at the Public Works Office was found dead after having complained of a sore throat the day before. The disease is now spreading throughout the court, and several more are already showing symptoms. The Mandate of Heaven is no longer with us, it would appear."
 china_events.52.a: "Flee to a countryside province."
 china_events.52.b: "We shall all remain in the capital."
 china_events.53.t: "Daggers in the Dark"
 china_events.53.d: "A scream echoes through the palace, but soon dissolves again into the silence and black of the night. A courtier has been murdered, found in his bedchamber with a blade buried deep in his back, and several stab wounds to the rest of his body. Fratricide and internal strife are becoming ever more common in $COUNTRY$, and many believe that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven."

 china_events.53.b: "Can the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] trust no one?"
 china_events.54.t: "The Concubine's Child"
 china_events.54.d: "For the past nine months you have been an expecting father, and today one of your concubines did indeed give birth to a son. The joy is cut short, however, when the child is brought before you. His face is deformed into what looks like a permanent scream, and soft, black fur-like hair grows in patches over his little body. The child is misshapen, and your physician suspects that the deformity has affected his mental capacities as well. Some claim that this disaster proves that we no longer enjoy the Mandate of Heaven."

 china_events.55.t: "The Riches of China"
 china_events.55.d: "The Emperor of China is weak and has little support.

Initially you put it down to some intricate playtime with one of his concubines, but recently it has begun to dawn on you that there is a remarkable connection between the lunar phase and the noises.

 china_events.59.t: "Tax Barges Sink"
 china_events.59.d: "Terrible news reach us from the Pearl River, where a number tax barges, carrying a substantial amount of the taxes for $YEAR$, has sunk during a particularly nasty bout of bad weather. The Grand Secretary of the Treasury interprets these events as a sign that our dynasty no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven, and argues that we must accept and respect this turn of providence.

 china_events.60.t: "False Edicts"
 china_events.60.d: "Provinces have reported to the capital that they are now in full compliance with several sets of new imperial edicts, the only problem is that you've never issued any such edicts. An investigation into the matter reveals that forged bronze plaques with written edicts, bearing your seal, have somehow found their way to the province governors. It is a dark time when people dare challenge the Emperor openly, and many claim that this is because our dynasty no longer enjoys the Mandate of Heaven. What shall we do about these false edicts?"

 EVTDESC11102: "Your majesty has been presented with a formidable gift in the form of a Jade seal of some level of craftsmanship. The gift has been presented by an up and coming administrator associated with the Bureaucrat faction. As nothing is free in The Middle Kingdom, he probably expects us to return the favor."

 EVTNAME11200: "The Buddha's Smile"
 EVTDESC11200: "The writings of Master Confucius are being forgotten in $PROVINCENAME$, as the inhabitants there have more and more taken to practicing the Buddhist rite. The news comes as a major setback for the Temple faction, which has prided itself on the successes of state-sanctioned Confucianism. We could dispatch officials to immediately restore order to the province, but forcing the locals into a different faith will most likely hurt the economic viability of the province."

 EVTOPTB11200: "Dispatch officials immediately."
 EVTNAME11206: "Bound Feet"
 EVTDESC11206: "Keeping the feet of young girls bound and tied until every bone in them has grown broken and deformed creates wonders of female and human beauty. The fashion of bound feet waxes and wanes every hundred years or so, and this time the wax seems to be due to the fact that the Temple faction is actively promoting this sound ideal of beauty all over the country."

 EVTDESC11220: "A traveler from Tibet has arrived in $CAPITAL$. He says that he has traveled from far-away Lhasa, and that he comes to spread the word of the Buddha. The Temple faction opposes this request, preferring instead the traditional teachings of Confucius as the sole font of spiritual guidance for our people.

 EVTNAME11222: "Burning of Books"
 EVTDESC11222: "The Temple faction has had enough of the discord and strife that plagues $COUNTRY$. Pointing to the myriad of schools of thought that flourish within the realm it is no wonder, they argue, that we live in troubled times. The Temple faction holds that only a return to true Confucian values can restore order, and what better way than to burn a few books of heterodox teachings?"

 EVTNAME11224: "Burying of Scholars"
 EVTDESC11224: "The Temple faction, tired of the pluralistic thought climate that has taken hold in China in the past few years, has taken matter into its own hands.

You can feel only a quiet rage welling up within you when you think of the futility of his death. The son of the Emperor, dead, not in war or battle, but from a pointless accident. The event is a clear sign that the Mandate of Heaven has passed from our dynasty, and that we need to regain it. His companions are from various factions, who should be punished for the incident?"

 EVTDESC4001: "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from local nobles. They are now up in arms over our latest demands which they feel are interfering with their privileges"
 EVTOPTA4001: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4001: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4002: "Provinces resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4002: "Our attempt to westernize is not popular everywhere in $COUNTRY$. Some of the provinces are asking for greater autonomy as a price to accept the changes."
 EVTOPTA4002: "Grant autonomy."
 EVTOPTB4002: "Slower Westernization."
 EVTNAME4003: "Peasants resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4003: "The ignorant serfs are getting uppity again, and are creating havoc over our reasonable demands to modernize and become civilized. This is outrageous, but the price to accept their demands may be too high."
 EVTOPTA4003: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4003: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4004: "The people resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4004: "Our attempts to westernize have met resistance from every strata of society and protesters from all corners of $COUNTRY$ demand we put a stop to this. Failing to do so may jeopardize the standing of the royal family."
 EVTOPTA4004: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4004: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4005: "Reactionaries resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4005: "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from reactionaries. They are now up in arms over our latest demands which they feel are interfering with their old privileges and traditions."
 EVTOPTA4005: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4005: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4006: "Merchants resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4006: "Our attempts to westernize have been met by refusals from our traders. Feeling hindered by new trade restrictions they threaten to move elsewhere, taking their trade with them."
 EVTOPTA4006: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4006: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4007: "Cultural Establishment resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4007: "Influential artists throughout the country have voiced concerns that our attempts at westernization are eroding our cultural identity and demand an immediate stop to this."
 EVTOPTA4007: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4007: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4008: "Government Officials resist Westernization"
 EVTDESC4008: "Several government officials have been voicing concerns that our attempts at westernization are going too fast and may drive the country to the brink of ruin. They advise an immediate stop to this or some of them might resign in protest."
 EVTOPTA4008: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4008: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4009: "High Command resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTB4009: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME4010: "Advisers resist Westernization"

 EVTOPTA4010: "Ignore their demands."
 EVTOPTB4010: "Accept the demands."
 EVTNAME9610: "Decline of Renaissance"
 EVTDESC9610: "The growth that our country has seen lately seems to have diverted much of both our resources and attention. The educational reforms and artistic development we were once known for have suffered accordingly, and we can no longer claim to be a leading nation when it comes to embracing the renaissance philosophy."
 EVTOPTA9610: "Very unfortunate."
 EVTNAME750: "Bad Reputation!"
 EVTDESC750: "Our recent strategy to carve new provinces out of whoever happens to be in the way surprisingly seems to have had a somewhat negative effect on our standing among our fellow nations."
 EVTOPTA750: "They are overreacting as always!"
 EVTNAME751: "Inflation"
 EVTDESC751: "The state of constant war has eroded our economy and now inflation is spiraling out of control!"
 EVTOPTA751: "Try minting more coins!"
 EVTNAME752: "Officers Deserting"
 EVTDESC752: "Disillusioned by the repeated and seemingly aimless wars of $MONARCH$, many officers in the army have deserted to seek better assignments elsewhere."
 EVTOPTA752: "Bah, I'll lead the army myself!"
 EVTNAME753: "Merchants Resented"
 EVTOPTA753: "Then I'll conquer them too!"
 EVTNAME754: "Legitimacy Questioned"
 EVTDESC754: "The bloodthirst shown by $MONARCH$ has ruined the reputation of $COUNTRY$ in the eyes of the world, and now our own subjects are starting to question the legitimacy of such a ruthless ruler."
 EVTOPTA754: "Tell my heir to start worrying..."
 EVTNAME755: "Magistrates Resigns"
 EVTDESC755: "Magistrates are the very sinews of a country, and unfortunately all ours are resigning!\n\n They claim this to be a protest to the burden of never-ending wars that has been laid upon them."
 EVTOPTA755: "I can do whatever they did myself!"
 EVTNAME756: "Advisor Resigns"
 EVTDESC756: "Horrified by our conquest-bent foreign policy, a leading court adviser has resigned and left the country!"
 EVTOPTA756: "Typical naysayer... Good riddance!"
 EVTNAME757: "$PROVINCENAME$ Revolts!"
 EVTDESC757: "The loyal subjects of $COUNTRY$ have long carried the enormous burden of the [Root.Owner.GetRulerTitleOrRegency]'s constant wars without complaint. Those days are now over...\n\nSince [Root.Owner.GetRulerOrRegency] doesn't seem to listen to reason, the people of $PROVINCENAME$ have decided to try saber rattling!"
 EVTOPTA757: "That I hear..."
 EVTNAME758: "We have been chosen!"
 EVTDESC758: "Good news, my $MONARCHTITLE$! The Emperor has bestowed the great honor of hosting this year's assembly of the Reichstag upon us.\n\nThis will greatly increase our prestige in the empire. May all delegates gasp in awe as they enter our glorious capital $PROVINCECAPITAL$!"
 EVTOPTA758: "Excellent!"
 EVTNAME773: "Merchants Assassinated!"
 EVTOPTA773: "Heads will roll! Hopefully not mine..."
 EVTNAME759: "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC759: "Since the tenth century the Archbishops of Mainz have held the prestigious title of ??YPrimas Germaniae??! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire.\n\nNaturally, such a title will inspire jealousy among the other princes of the Empire... We must take heed and not let our prestige drop too low, or we might find the title slip from our fingers!"
 EVTOPTA759: "I see..."
 EVTNAME760: "Title of Primas Germaniae Questioned"
 EVTDESC760: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, much of the Catholic community seem to have lost their faith in us! There are even rumors that another Archbishopric plans to claim our title as Primas Germaniae!"
 EVTOPTA760: "Probably just rumors."
 EVTNAME761: "Primas Germaniae"
 EVTDESC761: "The title of ??WPrimas Germaniae??! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - was created in the tenth century when the Archbishopric of Mainz became the first Archbishopric to receive it.\n\nFor the second-rate power of $FROM$ to hold such a prestigious title seems an affront to the Catholic Church. Perhaps a more worthy candidate can be found?"
 EVTOPTA761: "Perhaps... me?"
 EVTOPTB761: "Leave it be. For now..."
 EVTOPTC761: "A better one could not be found."
 EVTNAME762: "Primas Germaniae Lost"
 EVTDESC762: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, we have lost the prestigious title of ??WPrimas Germaniae??!. Due to our low standing in the empire of late, another Archbishop has gone ahead and claimed the title!"
 EVTOPTA762: "Very well, congratulate him..."
 EVTOPTB762: "We will not forget this!"
 EVTNAME763: "Legatus Natus"
 EVTDESC763: "We have long been honored with being the Pope's representative - ??WLegatus Natus??! - north of the Alps.\n\nSuch a prestigious title demands a certain level of dignity and we cannot let our prestige or our relations with the Pope drop too low."
 EVTOPTA763: "It's all in God's hands."
 EVTNAME764: "Title of Legatus Natus Lost"
 EVTDESC764: "Our standings in the Empire and with the Pope have declined lately. The Pope no longer seems to have confidence in us upholding our role as his delegate in the empire and has most unfortunately decided to relieve us of the title."
 EVTOPTA764: "I guess it was in my hands after all..."
 EVTNAME765: "Envoy from the Pope"
 EVTDESC765: "Good news! We have been selected by the Pope to hold the prestigious title of ??WLegatus Natus??! - his representative north of the Alps - after the former holder fell from grace."
 EVTOPTA765: "Is that a crepuscular ray shining in?"
 EVTOPTB765: "We must graciously decline."
 EVTDESC6197: "Our policy of supporting and expanding the bureaucracy of our nation is really paying off. Every day new officials are trained and set off to glorious new careers in our administration!"
 EVTOPTA6197: "Excellent!"
 EVTDESC6198: "An empire of this size needs a lot of bureaucrats, perhaps offering a sign up bonus will encourage their numbers to grow?"
 EVTOPTA6198: "Whatever it takes."
 EVTOPTB6198: "Not right now."
 EVTNAME2036: "Religious Turmoil"
 EVTDESC2036: "Reports have reached us that the Emperor is planning to march against all Protestant states in the Empire. He is determined to cleanse the Holy Roman lands of all heretics before the end of the year. If we are to stay true to our faith, we'll have to make preparations."
 EVTOPTA2036: "Proclaim religious independence."
 EVTOPTB2036: "Our allegiance lies with the Emperor."
 EVTNAME6100: "Popular Support for our Grand Navy"
 EVTDESC6100: "Across the land people are supporting our Grand Navy, making contributions towards the defense of our nation. In the shipyards our shipwrights are working ever harder, and people are even volunteering to become sailors! People take pride in our great Navy."
 EVTOPTA6100: "That's just fantastic."
 EVTNAME6101: "Popular Enthusiasm for our Navy diminishes"
 EVTDESC6101: "To be honest our people do not feel that our Navy is so grand anymore, in fact they just plain don't like it. Press gangs are finding it even harder than usual and even acquiring basic materials is a struggle."
 EVTOPTA6101: "This is only a short term problem."
 EVTOPTB6101: "This is nothing a little money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6102: "Promising Admiral Appears"
 EVTDESC6102: "One of our Seahawks has turned out to be much better than we first expected."
 EVTOPTA6102: "I knew this was a good idea."
 EVTNAME6103: "Aristocrats concerned"
 EVTDESC6103: "Our policy of appointing promising commanders regardless of birth is upsetting our aristocrats who find it hard to dine with men who lack breeding. According to our aristocrats it is also upsetting the men under their command, who expect to be led by their betters rather than by someone who is plainly not a gentleman."
 EVTOPTA6103: "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6103: "Well, we can make a few concessions."
 EVTNAME6104: "Naval Developments"
 EVTDESC6104: "Our use of superior seamanship is leading to huge developments in naval thought, which will benefit our fleet for many years to come."
 EVTOPTA6104: "This just can't be bad."
 EVTNAME6105: "Naval Hubris"
 EVTDESC6105: "Our seamanship is so superior that to be honest complacency is setting in. People are content to rest on their laurels, but this could make us vulnerable to challenges by would-be upstarts."
 EVTOPTA6105: "Our Navy is the best."
 EVTOPTB6105: "We must shake them up a little."
 EVTNAME6106: "Improved Blockade Tactics"
 EVTDESC6106: "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to develop much improved blockade tactics. Although our enemies will eventually counter them, for the moment we will really be able to turn the screw."
 EVTOPTA6106: "We might even make some money out of this."
 EVTNAME6107: "Slipping Standards"
 EVTDESC6107: "Our use of naval fighting instruction has allowed us to put up fearsome blockades of enemy coasts, but at the moment our sailors are just getting a bit lazy."
 EVTOPTA6107: "Well we can't expect them to operate at peak efficiency all the time."
 EVTOPTB6107: "I expect every man to do his duty no matter what."
 EVTNAME6108: "Naval Technical Developments"
 EVTDESC6108: "Our shipwrights are already excellent, but they are currently undergoing a burst of creativity that is leading to newer technical developments."
 EVTOPTA6108: "Who am I to stop them?"
 EVTNAME6109: "Concerned Shipwrights"
 EVTDESC6109: "For reasons we cannot fathom our shipwrights feel that they are not getting the backing and support from the naval establishment. However, ruling a nation is a lot of work, do we really care about such a minor matter?"
 EVTOPTA6109: "Why should I care about people who are so poor they have to work?"
 EVTOPTB6109: "Time to upset the Naval Establishment."
 EVTNAME6110: "We Rule the Waves"
 EVTDESC6110: "Our glorious navy is the pride of our nation and the envy of the world."
 EVTOPTA6110: "More Glory for us."
 EVTNAME6111: "The Fleet has Declined"
 EVTDESC6111: "No one can quite understand it. One minute we had a glorious navy that the whole nation took pride in. Now the world laughs at our fleet."
 EVTOPTA6111: "The glory days will return."
 EVTOPTB6111: "A little money might sort things out."
 EVTNAME6112: "Recruits flock to the standards"
 EVTDESC6112: "Our system of national conscripts is proving very successful, the poor, the desperate, even the patriotic are flocking to the colors. The Generals are pleased."
 EVTOPTA6112: "Let's get them into the army now."
 EVTOPTB6112: "No, we must think long term here."
 EVTNAME6113: "People don't want to be conscripted"
 EVTDESC6113: "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113: "Well I am sure we can slow down recruitment in the short term"
 EVTOPTB6113: "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners."
 EVTNAME6114: "Isn't our Army Grand?"
 EVTDESC6114: "Our Grand Army is so grand that it is marching from one victory to another. Experience from those victories positively impacts recruitment and training of new soldiers."
 EVTOPTA6114: "This is fantastic."
 EVTNAME6115: "Our Army is not so Grand"
 EVTDESC6115: "One minute our army is the envy of the world, next no one has anything good to say about it. We have no idea how our grand army slipped so, but it could end up affecting recruitment."
 EVTOPTA6115: "Looks like recruitment will be a little harder."
 EVTOPTB6115: "Time to shake up the military establishment!"
 EVTNAME6116: "Military Improvements"
 EVTDESC6116: "Our officers are experimenting with new ways to drill our already superbly drilled army. This seems to be raising the overall level of military thought in our nation."
 EVTOPTA6116: "I like military thinkers!"
 EVTNAME6117: "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117: "Our superbly drilled army is in the opinion of our most influential generals invincible. Any recent setbacks are down to the weather or the enemy using such unmanly things as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned there is no way to improve on perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117: "Invincible, I like the sound of it..."
 EVTOPTB6117: "I think the truth may upset some people."
 EVTNAME6118: "Fortification Effort"
 EVTDESC6118: "Our Engineering Corps is currently short of things to do, however, they have found a province without any fortifications and have taken upon themselves to sort this out."
 EVTOPTA6118: "That is very nice of them."
 EVTNAME6119: "Fortification Enhancement"
 EVTDESC6119: "Our Engineering Corps has found a minor fortification that could do with some improvements."
 EVTOPTA6119: "We must always seek improvements wherever possible."
 EVTNAME6120: "Our Engineers are busy"
 EVTDESC6120: "Our Engineer Corps is always finding ways to keep themselves occupied. Today they upgraded a fortification in one of our provinces."
 EVTOPTA6120: "We are pleased."
 EVTNAME6121: "Fortification works"
 EVTDESC6121: "Our Engineers have enhanced a fortification making it a substantial barrier to enemy forces."
 EVTOPTA6121: "Let's hope someone tries to siege it"
 EVTNAME6122: "Epic Fortification built"
 EVTDESC6122: "An already substantial fortification has been enhanced by our engineers, although some of our generals feel that our troops are wasted cowering behind forts."
 EVTOPTA6122: "One mustn't grumble."
 EVTNAME6123: "New Bastions built"
 EVTDESC6123: "Just when it seemed that our fortifications couldn't get any better. One of our engineers came up with this great idea of triangular bastions. Not only do they look great, they also seem to slow down the enemy."
 EVTOPTA6123: "I guess I shouldn't complain."
 EVTNAME6124: "Fort falls into disrepair"
 EVTDESC6124: "A minor fortification has been neglected by our engineers and has fallen into disrepair. To be honest, at the moment it probably wouldn't even delay a party of school children, never mind an invading army."
 EVTOPTA6124: "Real men don't hide behind forts!"
 EVTOPTB6124: "Perhaps some repairs are in order..."
 EVTNAME6125: "Fort decays"
 EVTDESC6125: "Our Engineers have sadly neglected the condition of this fortification, unless an action is taken the fort will only offer minimal protection."
 EVTOPTA6125: "It isn't important..."
 EVTOPTB6125: "There's nothing money can't solve."
 EVTNAME6126: "Fort Crumbles"
 EVTDESC6126: "A recent audit has revealed that the walls of one of our fortifications is crumbling, while our engineering corps claims that there isn't enough money for repairs. If nothing is done its defensive ability will be reduced, however, on the long term basis it might become a major tourist attraction in a few hundred years time, boosting the local economy."
 EVTOPTA6126: "Let's go for long term gain."
 EVTOPTB6126: "I think a more short term approach is in order."
 EVTNAME6127: "Fort Weakens"
 EVTDESC6127: "Poor maintenance work by Engineer Corps has left one of our more substantial fortifications with serious structural damage. For this fort to remain up to spec major structural work will be required."
 EVTOPTA6127: "Just punish a few of the people responsible."
 EVTOPTB6127: "No, let's spend the money."
 EVTNAME6128: "Complacent Engineers"
 EVTDESC6128: "It has been discovered that one of our largest fortifications is no longer up to the job after a bout of complacency in our engineer corps."
 EVTOPTA6128: "If the experts are getting complacent I am sure things must be fine."
 EVTOPTB6128: "Action must be taken."
 EVTNAME6129: "Fortification Crisis"
 EVTDESC6129: "Neglect by our Engineer Corps has left one of our most powerful and modern fortification with a weakened wall. A besieging army may be able to exploit this."
 EVTOPTA6129: "The experts have spoken."
 EVTOPTB6129: "No! We will do something immediately."
 EVTNAME6130: "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130: "Our policy of battlefield commissions has been very successful, a new general has emerged."
 EVTOPTA6130: "Well, he shows promise."
 EVTNAME6131: "Nobility Concerned with the Loss of Privileges"
 EVTDESC6131: "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131: "Does the nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131: "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better."
 EVTNAME6132: "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132: "Our Glorious Army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132: "Glory to us!"
 EVTNAME6133: "Our Army has seen Better Days"
 EVTDESC6133: "The varnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just aren't taking our army as seriously as before."
 EVTOPTA6133: "Time to shake things up then!"
 EVTOPTB6133: "I don't think there is much that can be done..."
 EVTNAME6134: "Adventurous Merchants"
 EVTDESC6134: "Current trading conditions are strongly favoring our merchants. Our merchants are ready to take advantage of these."
 EVTOPTA6134: "Excellent."
 EVTNAME6135: "Our Merchants are doing Poorly"
 EVTDESC6135: "Although previously our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135: "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts!"
 EVTOPTB6135: "A few unpopular reforms are the answer."
 EVTNAME6136: "Colonist Rush"
 EVTDESC6136: "Rumors of our Quest for the New World have led to more people readying themselves for a new life as a colonial settler."
 EVTOPTA6136: "They might be useful."
 EVTNAME6137: "People Flee to the Colonies"
 EVTDESC6137: "Our Quest for the New World has opened up opportunities for people in our colonies. The continuing war has convinced many of the best and brightest that the time to take these opportunities is now."
 EVTOPTA6137: "Let them go."
 EVTOPTB6137: "They must be stopped."
 EVTNAME6138: "The [empty_neighbor_target.GetAreaName] Company"
 EVTDESC6138: "The [This.GetAreaName] Company that was charged with the duty of claiming [This.GetName] in the name of [This.Owner.GetName] has decided instead to expand its borders to an adjacent region close to our colony. The promise of a new life in this uninhabited land is greatly appealing to the [Root.Owner.Culture.GetName] settlers, and should we permit the expansion, it will attract a far greater number of settlers than our existing colony in [This.GetName]."
 colonial.1.d: "Our nation is surrounded by territories as yet unclaimed by any of our rivals. Our ambition to expand the lands belonging to the crown has spread into nationalistic fervor within our people, and a new private company has established itself in [Root.GetName] with the ambition of bringing new settlers to the lands of [empty_neighbor_target.GetName] to claim the territory for Glory, Gold, [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName], and the [empty_neighbor_target.GetAreaName] Company. Should we permit the expansion, they will bring a great deal of settlers to the province and rapidly expand [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] influence in the area."
 EVTOPTA6138: "This can only be good."
 colonial.1.c: "Use their fervor to excite a baby boom in [Root.GetName] instead."
 EVTNAME6139: "Colonial Company goes Bankrupt"
 EVTDESC6139: "One of colonial ventures has run into serious financial trouble, if no action is taken the colonists could suffer."
 EVTOPTA6139: "They knew the risks, it's not my problem."
 EVTOPTB6139: "Time for us to step in."
 EVTOPTA6140: "Excellent news."
 EVTNAME6141: "Trade Complacency"
 EVTDESC6141: "Although as a nation we are famous for our shrewd commerce practices, at the moment our merchants are becoming a tad complacent."
 EVTOPTA6141: "I can see our merchants not competing as well."
 EVTOPTB6141: "I think prices could be rising."
 EVTNAME6142: "Excellent Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6142: "Every so often a country is blessed with honest men working hard for the state. A number of good viceroys across our overseas holdings are giving us a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6142: "We are pleased to hear this."
 EVTNAME6143: "Corrupt Viceroys"
 EVTDESC6143: "Overseas provinces are notoriously too hard to police and good viceroys are essential. Sometimes though things don't work according to the plan, and corrupt and venal men end up in charge."
 EVTOPTA6143: "Take action."
 EVTOPTB6143: "Just turn a blind eye."
 EVTNAME6144: "Production Improvements"
 EVTDESC6144: "Our embracing of Smithian Economics has led to people spending time thinking about how things are produced. For the moment it seems to have paid off."
 EVTOPTA6144: "This is good."
 EVTNAME6145: "Production Stifled"
 EVTDESC6145: "Our producers become complacent as our use of Smithian Economics led to our production techniques being so advanced."
 EVTOPTA6145: "I think this will hurt production."
 EVTOPTB6145: "Actually it seems to have translated into higher prices."
 EVTNAME6146: "Successful Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6146: "On an annual basis bureaucracy gives the country a nice little tax boost, but sometimes the right men in the right place can give the country that little bit extra. It is a shame that a few years down the line you have to promote them beyond their ability."
 EVTOPTA6146: "Make hay while the sun shines."
 EVTNAME6147: "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
 EVTDESC6147: "Bureaucracy sometimes just doesn't work. The wrong men in the wrong places can lead to corrupt practices which hurt the country's income. Even worse, it will take a few years to get the proper paperwork to change it."
 EVTOPTA6147: "You just can't fight the system."
 EVTNAME6148: "National Bank pays dividends"
 EVTDESC6148: "Several shrewd loans have led to very good profits at our National Bank. The bank is hiking its dividend and buying back some of its shares."
 EVTOPTA6148: "We're in the money."
 EVTNAME6149: "National Bank in Trouble"
 EVTDESC6149: "Our National Bank is doing very poorly. It is finding it hard to lend to reliable people and is running into difficulties."
 EVTOPTA6149: "We'll give it some money to support it!"
 EVTOPTB6149: "Tell the bank to lend to slightly less reliable people."
 EVTNAME6150: "Trade Policy Success"
 EVTDESC6150: "Our National Trade Policy is proving unusually successful at the moment. This is giving our merchants a real boost."
 EVTOPTA6150: "I am sure this is good news."
 EVTNAME6151: "Trade Policy is Failing"
 EVTDESC6151: "Our National Trade Policy isn't really delivering at the moment. Our merchant just aren't doing as well."
 EVTOPTA6151: "Looks like the merchants are struggling."
 EVTOPTB6151: "We should grease the wheels a little more..."
 EVTNAME6152: "New Spy Techniques"
 EVTDESC6152: "Our Espionage system is performing and our agents have found new ways to spy on people. Sooner or later our 'friends' and enemies will find out, but for the moment we have an edge."
 EVTOPTA6152: "I like edges."
 EVTNAME6153: "Spy Defections"
 EVTDESC6153: "Some of the spies in our espionage system are defecting to other countries. This could hurt us in the short term."
 EVTOPTA6153: "Let the disloyal elements go."
 EVTOPTB6153: "A small cash sum might change a few minds."
 EVTNAME6154: "Cabinet Dynamism"
 EVTDESC6154: "A combination of just the correct people in our cabinet can create conditions for a nice little boost in tax income. You will be pleased to hear that this has just happened."
 EVTOPTA6154: "This is good news indeed."
 EVTNAME6155: "Government Corruption"
 EVTDESC6155: "When the wrong men get into your cabinet it can mean bad news for the country, also it is difficult to remove them."
 EVTOPTA6155: "It looks like our taxes are dropping."
 EVTOPTB6155: "Inflation is on the rise."
 EVTNAME6156: "Minority Prospers"
 EVTDESC6156: "With their legal status guaranteed by our Bill of Rights, our [minority_religion_province.Culture.GetName] minority is prospering under our rule."
 EVTOPTA6156: "Good to see."
 EVTNAME6157: "Backlash"
 EVTDESC6157: "Since we introduced the Bill of Rights many of our original ruling classes have been feeling marginalized, however, rather than discuss it they seem to be staging a revolt."
 EVTOPTA6157: "Why don't they just discuss this like gentlemen?"
 EVTNAME6158: "The Clergy Mobilizes Population"
 EVTDESC6158: "For many years our policies have motivated a large majority of our population to dutifully attend the expected religious ceremonies. The clergy has shown its thanks for our supportive policy by in turn making supportive comments about our government."
 EVTOPTA6158: "May our people always find unity through faith."
 EVTNAME6159: "Religious Divergences"
 EVTDESC6159: "We are in many ways seen as one of the foremost defenders of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith. Our religious institutions are strong and priests both here and abroad flock to our seminars.\nIt is therefore somewhat embarrassing that the rural population in our country isn't quite as in tune with the theology as we are. Reports of deviations such as a dog being proclaimed a saint or old heathen festivals being integrated with the holy ceremonies of our faith is undermining our state."
 EVTOPTA6159: "Let them complain."
 EVTOPTB6159: "Attempt to make them abandon their ways."

 EVTNAME6165: "His Holiness is Shocked"
 EVTDESC6165: "As we are an enlightened and tolerant society, some of our citizens have decided that the Catholic faith does not fit in with their current lifestyle choice and have decided instead to embrace Protestantism."
 EVTOPTA6165: "Well I am sure the Pope can live with this."
 EVTNAME6166: "The Orthodox Faith is Rocked"
 EVTDESC6166: "The Patriarch arrived today to express his anger that our policy of tolerance has allowed the schismatics who sacked holy Constantinople and abandoned the Roman Empire to spread their faith in our realm."

 EVTDESC6172: "Church elders believe that, as God has ordained, that our tolerant policies should be punished with our people converting to Catholicism, the apocalypse is surely just round the corner."

 EVTNAME6173: "God Punishing us?"
 EVTDESC6173: "Church Elders are of the opinion that our Merciful Lord is punishing us for the sinful policy of humanist tolerance. Certainly the Orthodox faith is advancing in our realm."

 EVTNAME6174: "Church Elders concerned"
 EVTDESC6174: "Senior Elders in our church have expressed the opinion that the recent mass conversion to Protestantism was yet another sign of our Lord's divine wrath. Slightly more skeptical government officials think that our policy of tolerance may be a more likely cause."
 EVTOPTA6174: "I guess you reap what you sow."
 EVTNAME6175: "Ulema Concerned"
 EVTDESC6175: "The Ulema are increasingly concerned that we are being too tolerant to the schismatic followers of Ali. They feel that Allah the compassionate, the merciful, will be angered by this. Regardless, their faith is advancing in our country."

 EVTNAME6176: "Ayatollahs are concerned"
 EVTDESC6176: "A delegation of senior Ayatollahs advised us today that our policy of tolerance has allowed the advancement of Sunni Islam in our realm. They are concerned that this may delay the return of the Mahdi."

 EVTNAME6177: "Monks concerned"
 EVTDESC6177: "A delegation of senior Monks, after several days of meditation, have come to suggest that our tolerant policy is affecting the enlightenment of our realm. It seems that some of our people have decided to embrace the Hindu faith."

 EVTNAME6178: "People turn to Philosophy!"
 EVTDESC6178: "In a move that could rock the Karma of the whole nation, some of our people have decided to turn their back on the teachings of the Lord Buddha and instead embrace the teachings of a Chinese philosopher. Senior Monks believe that our policy of tolerance is the cause of this."

 EVTNAME6183: "People turn to Buddhism"
 EVTDESC6183: "Some of our people have decided that as we are so tolerant that there would be no problems in becoming Buddhists. Confucius says 'Do not be concerned about others appreciating you. Be concerned about your not appreciating others.'"
 EVTOPTA6183: "We live in Interesting times."
 EVTNAME6184: "People start worshiping Hinduism"
 EVTDESC6184: "With our tolerance of other faiths people have decided to embrace Hinduism.

Lead through virtue, discipline through the rites, and there will be a sense of shame and conscientious improvements.'"
 EVTOPTA6184: "These things do happen."
 EVTNAME6185: "Our People embrace Shintoism"
 EVTDESC6185: "Our Humanist Tolerance has led some of our people to become Shintoists. Confucius says 'If a man is without benevolences, then of what use are the rights? If a man is without benevolences, then of what use is music?'."

 EVTNAME6186: "Our Priests express mild displeasure"

 EVTOPTD6191: "Government is vital!"
 EVTOPTE6191: "Actually I think trade should benefit!"
 EVTNAME6192: "Scientific Revolution Halts"
 EVTDESC6192: "At the moment our scientists seem to be running out of things to discover. Well, probably not, but the revolution has slowed down for the moment."

 EVTDESC6196: "We have often made it clear that the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is the one true faith, assuring our people that a war against [infidel_neighbor.GetUsableName] is imminent, considering our religious differences. However, many of our subjects are currently disappointed in us as we have failed to pursue any kind of war against our neighbors, [infidel_neighbor.GetUsableName]. Some take to the streets to show their discontent."

 EVTDESC6430: "An outbreak of disease has swept through the local population weakening the local populace. This has led to a reduction in the number of healthy people we can export as slaves."
 EVTOPTA6430: "It will pass."
 EVTNAME6431: "Quality Ivory"
 EVTDESC6431: "Our ivory production has of late been of much higher quality than usual. People are admiring the quality of the workmanship."

 EVTNAME6432: "Tea Party"
 EVTDESC6432: "Local residents in [tea_province.GetName], upset at seeing their high quality tea shipped abroad, have attacked a tea ship and thrown the cargo into the harbor. Although the overall quantity was negligible, the province does have a little discontent."

 EVTDESC6434: "The spice harvest in one of our spice producing regions has failed, although not badly. However, production will be reduced due to this."
 EVTOPTA6434: "This is not ideal."
 EVTNAME6435: "Slave uprising"
 EVTDESC6435: "Slaves at one of our plantations have staged an uprising, which was suppressed. Although the brutality of the suppression has led to rising discontentment amongst the happy servile population."
 EVTOPTA6435: "They should know their place."
 EVTNAME6500: "Liberum Veto"
 EVTDESC6500: "Our nobility have come to us with an interesting proposal. If we were to grant them the Liberum Veto they would in return give us substantial support during the current war. Although their offer is very generous indeed, some of our advisors are suggesting that this could just be the thin edge of the wedge. In fact although they will get angry if we refuse them, they will most definitely prey on any future weakness we show to demand further concessions."
 EVTOPTA6500: "It's only a Latin phrase."
 EVTOPTB6500: "Let them revolt!"
 EVTNAME6501: "Further concessions demanded"
 EVTDESC6501: "As we have graciously granted the Liberum Veto, our nobility are demanding further concessions or they will use their right of confederation against us."
 EVTOPTA6501: "We grant these concessions."
 EVTOPTB6501: "I fear no confederation."
 EVTNAME6502: "Noble Support"
 EVTDESC6502: "Our nobles fear that should their lands be lost to the enemy they will no longer enjoy the Liberum Veto. Thus they are making contributions towards the war effort."
 EVTOPTA6502: "Excellent!"
 EVTNAME6503: "Reform"
 EVTDESC6503: "For a long time the power of the government has been seriously restricted by the granting of the Liberum Veto. Now the government finally feels strong enough to consider reform. However, our neighbors may not look too kindly on our attempts to strengthen the state."
 EVTOPTA6503: "Yes, we must."
 EVTOPTB6503: "No, it's not the right time."
 EVTNAME6504: "End of the Liberum Veto"
 EVTDESC6504: "One of neighbors had very kindly kept itself weak and divided by having the policy of the Liberum Veto. Now, however, they have started to reform and so will greatly strengthen."
 EVTOPTA6504: "Time to take action."
 EVTNAME6601: "The Revolution is Here"
 EVTDESC6601: "The Revolution has arrived! The [Root.GovernmentName] has collapsed under its own weight as the revolutionary masses stormed key government buildings. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was captured in the chaos, and although it initially seemed that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] might be able to negotiate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way out of it with modest concessions, soon the revolutionary leaders saw through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ploy and opted to limit [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] influence by removing [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] head. Although [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] diehard supporters were convinced that the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] would soon grow another one, this did not happen.\n\nInstead, a purely temporary Committee of Public Safety has been appointed to guide the new Republic through this revolutionary period. Threats abound, however, for monarchs and despots across Europe fear they may be the Revolution's next victim and are already preparing for war against us. On the bright side, liberal forces are looking to us for assistance in their own struggles, so we will be able to gain support in such a manner."
 EVTOPTA6601: "Vive la Revolution!"
 EVTNAME6602: "Defense of the revolution"
 EVTDESC6602: "The forces of reaction not only refuse to accept that our revolutionary government should be considered one of the family of Europe, but also deny our manifest right to spread our revolution to other needy countries. Our people are rallying to support the revolution."
 EVTOPTA6602: "We must fight on."
 EVTNAME6603: "The Revolution must be contained"
 EVTDESC6603: "The evil revolutionary government is not only doing vile things like removing feudal obligations, taxing the clergy and beheading nobles, but they are also exporting their revolutionary dogma to other countries, whether they want it or not. Right-thinking people in our realm are rallying to the support of our divinely appointed monarch in his struggle against the great enemy."
 EVTOPTA6603: "We will overcome."
 EVTNAME6604: "The Revolution is Over"
 EVTDESC6604: "Reactionary forces have deposed the government of the people, replacing our godless revolutionary government with a divinely ordained King. People are dusting off all the old monarchist symbols."
 EVTOPTA6604: "All good things..."
 EVTNAME6605: "Order has Triumphed!"
 EVTDESC6605: "Our victorious armies have managed to depose the foul revolutionary government and a proper God-anointed monarch has been put in power. All we need do now is agree to a just peace."
 EVTOTPA6605: "Rejoice!"
 EVTNAME6606: "The Storming of the Bastille"
 EVTDESC6606: "The Revolution has arrived! The mob of the third estate has risen in revolt and stormed the Bastille, overthrowing the ancien regime. [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] was captured in the chaos, and although it initially seemed that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] might be able to negotiate [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] way out of it with modest concessions, soon the revolutionary leaders saw through [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] ploy. They decided that [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can best assist the Revolution through science, by being the first to try out Dr. Guillotin?fs new invention.\n\nWith the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] out of the way, a new revolutionary republic has been installed with such strange notions as inalienable rights for everyone (not just monarchs). Threats abound, however, for monarchs and despots across Europe fear they may be the Revolution's next victim and are already preparing for war against us. On the bright side, liberal forces are looking to us for assistance in their own struggles, so we will be able to gain support in such a manner."
 EVTOPTA6606: "Aujourd'hui, rien."
 EVTNAME6607: "The Restoration"
 EVTDESC6607: "The forces of order have finally emerged triumphant, the ancien regime has been restored and France is back to normal."
 EVTOPTA6607: "Let most Frenchmen rejoice."
 EVTNAME6608: "The End of the Monarchy"
 EVTDESC6608: "Due to the monarchy's failure to adapt to the new more progressive climate, a revolutionary court has decided that our monarch will assist with science instead. The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] of the ancien regime will be the first to try out our new invention by Dr. Guillotin."
 EVTOPTA6608: "So are the ways of progress."
 EVTNAME6609: "The Exile of the Revolutionaries"
 EVTDESC6609: "With the fall of the revolutionary government the leaders of the revolution have gone into exile, giving France back its proper king."
 EVTOPTA6609: "Vive Le Roi!"
 EVTNAME6610: "The Revolution Advances"
 EVTDESC6610: "With the end of Royal Absolutism, a new government based on liberal principals emerged. However, continuing instability and attempts by the monarchy to reassert absolutism have radicalized the situation. The government has now switched to being outright revolutionary and the Bourbon monarch has been beheaded. The rest of Europe is shocked."
 EVTOPTA6610: "Vive la France."

 EVTOPTA1042: "They won't get far!"
 EVTNAME1043: "Venezuela's quest for independence"
 EVTDESC1043: "Small guerrilla groups have begun to terrorize the countryside in some of our northern colonies in South America. A few attempts have even been made to overthrow our colonial governor and declare the land an independent state.

 EVTNAME1044: "Paraguay's quest for independence"
 EVTDESC1044: "Independence movements have begun to surface in several areas of our South American provinces. It won't be long before they overthrow our local government if we don't take action. How do you want to proceed?"

 EVTNAME1045: "Haiti's quest for independence"
 EVTDESC1045: "A small group of rebels have begun to disturb the order in our Caribbean colonies. Some of them are even spreading ideas about an independent Haitian state. This could prove quite a challenge if not handled properly."
 EVTOPTA1045: "They won't last long!"
 EVTNAME1012: "Westphalia"
 EVTDESC1012: "Initially it was a small duchy established in the 12th century east of the Rhine River but over time the area grew in importance especially during the Middle Ages as several cities in the Westphalian region such as Munster and Osnabruck prospered as members of the Hanseatic League."
 EVTOPTA1012: "Support the idea of a Westphalian Nation."
 EVTNAME1082: "The Papal State"
 EVTDESC1082: "It truly saddens us to see that the dominions of the Pope have all but disappeared. Our strong devotion makes us the ideal candidate responsible for establishing a new Papal State. Perhaps we should cede a province of ours?"

 EVTOPTB1082: "Perhaps not."
 EVTNAME9090: "The release of $FROM$"
 EVTDESC9090: "$FROMCOUNTRY$ has made the decision to hand over the unlawfully-held province of $FROM$. They chose ... wisely.\n\nTo avoid similar accusations of holding unlawful imperial provinces, it would be wise to restore the province to its rightful owner as soon as possible."

 EVTOPTB9090: "Release it to the previous owner."
 EVTNAME9091: "The province of $FROM$"

 EVTNAME962: "Title of Primas Germaniae Lost"
 EVTDESC962: "The prestigious title ??WPrimas Germaniae??! can only be held by a Catholic spiritual elector. As we no longer meet these requirements, the Pope has revoked the privilege."
 EVTOPTA962: "Most unfortunate."
 EVTNAME96200: "Envoy from the Pope"
 EVTDESC96200: "Good news! We have been selected by the Pope to hold the prestigious title of ??WPrimas Germaniae??! - the most important Catholic Archbishop throughout the Holy Roman Empire - after the former holder fell from grace."

 EVTNAME851: "The House of $DYNASTY$ is shaken"
 EVTDESC851: "There seems to have been a misunderstanding regarding the heritage of the great grandmother of $MONARCH$. It seems that she was the daughter of a lowly farmer from outside $CAPITAL_CITY$."

 EVTNAME855: "Warriors do not read books"
 EVTDESC855: "With the war taking the focus of every capable and productive person in the nation, there is a lot less time for frivolous activities of musicians and poets. And even the best of poets is no better a soldier than a common farmer."
 EVTOPTA855: "The sword is stronger than the book."
 EVTNAME859: "War-Weary Population"
 EVTDESC859: "Our peasants are tired of our war and our soldiers are exhausted. It is becoming increasingly difficult to force them to fight for us, as they find ever more creative methods to dodge conscription. Even those in the army think more of home than of the glory of defeating our enemy. We should conclude the war quickly or it may soon take a turn for the worse."

 EVTNAME863: "Merchants Spread Thin"
 EVTDESC863: "Our merchants bring in money from trade all over the world. However, it seems that they have somewhat overstretched, and the [Root.GovernmentName] is not able to give them the full support of [Root.GetUsableName]'s diplomatic clout.

 EVTOPTA866: "Spare no expenses..."
 EVTOPTB866: "Use Caution."
 EVTNAME867: "Improvements in Naval Technology"

 EVTOPTA867: "Spare no expenses..."
 EVTOPTB867: "Use Caution."
 EVTNAME868: "Improvements in Trade Technology"

 EVTNAME869: "Improvements in Government Technology"

 EVTNAME871: "Sale of Titles"
 EVTDESC871: "My lord, one of your advisors has suggested selling off noble titles to anyone who can afford to pay. It could bring in lots of money and open a way for social advancement for the rich if we do, but it would devalue the idea of nobility and perhaps upset the existing aristocratic families. Should we do this?"
 EVTOPTA871: "Gold is the sign of nobility!"
 EVTOPTB871: "Nobility cannot be bought!"
 EVTNAME872: "A Traveling Minstrel"

 EVTOPTC875: "Burn the witch!"
 EVTNAME876: "Bible printed!"
 EVTDESC876: "A talented [Root.GetAdjective] inventor has made something many considered impossible. He managed to devise a method that allows him to build a press to print huge amounts of copies of the Holy Bible, allowing every Christian to have one and rendering many monks across the world jobless.

As the classics are rediscovered in Europe, the whole continent is going to change forever."

[Root.GetEventAdvisorSheHeCap] dares to denounce our great [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s policies and recently did so in public in front of foreign ambassadors. Even if there might be some grounds for these criticisms, we shouldn't let open disparagement of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] become a habit."

 EVTOPTA950: "As Planned"
 EVTDESC9551: "Discussions regarding ways to expand our trade have been ongoing in the Parliament for some time now. We already have exclusive control over a local trade node but there are many who are enticed by the possibilities of overseas trading. Others are convinced that the risks are too great and that more money could be made at home."
 EVTDESC9553: "Our Parliament is divided regarding the proposal to establish a new trade node. Most of them can't see any logical reason to why such a prominent trading nation as our own shouldn't have its own trade node, but as we all know, these things don't come cheap and therefore require careful consideration."
 EVTDESC753: "Apparently citing disgust with $COUNTRY$'s endless wars of conquest some Trade Nodes have decided to expel our merchants."
 EVTDESC773: "Some countries are apparently so appalled by our foreign policy that they've decided to retaliate by assassinating our merchants in an attempt to strike at our finances!\n\nWhat makes it even more shocking is that it happens even in our own Trade Nodes..."
 EVTDESC9512: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area has proved to be the perfect trade node for ivory. Our government couldn't be happier."
 EVTDESC2008: "Thoughts of disapproval against the Roman Catholic Church are spreading across Europe as a result of the increasing corruption of monks and clerics. Voices are raised questioning the current principles and greed of the Church. $COUNTRY$, which was recently swayed by these so called heresies, has now openly broken with Rome and declared itself Protestant."
 EVTDESC2009: "The Protestant Reformation is spreading like wildfire across Europe. Several different movements have already formed, proposing alternative ways of reforming the Christian faith. The so called Reformed school of thought has come to dominate $COUNTRY$. Now, $MONARCH$ has decided to renounce Catholicism entirely and adopt a Reformed form of Christianity."
 EVTNAME700: "Election!"
 EVTDESC700: "The term is up for $MONARCH$. With enough support [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] can stay in office, but then [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] must defeat [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] three primary competitors..."
 EVTDESC701: "The unfortunate passing of $MONARCH$ forces us to hold a premature election. Three primary candidates have been nominated..."
 EVTOPTA700: "Keep $MONARCH$"
 EVTOPTB700: "Bureaucrat Candidate"
 EVTOPTC700: "Diplomat Candidate"
 EVTOPTD700: "Military Candidate"

 EVTNAME2011: "The Reformation Branches Out"
 EVTDESC2011: "The Protestant Reformation is spreading like wildfire across Europe. Several different movements have already formed, proposing alternative ways of reforming the Christian faith. A devout preacher in $CAPITAL$ has become the principal figure for the so called Reformed school of thought, stressing the complete ruin of humanity's ethical nature. Only with the divine intervention of God can humanity find salvation, turning from rebellion to willing obedience."
 EVTNAME9500: "Grain"
 EVTDESC9500: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the land is very fertile and would be highly suitable for agricultural production of anything from cereals and vegetable foodstuff to more exotic crops."
 EVTOPTA9500: "You can never have too much grain"
 EVTNAME9501: "Fish"
 EVTDESC9501: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the surrounding waters have a very rich supply of fish. Fish may be one of the most basic foods available but it's nonetheless an important resource."
 EVTOPTA9501: "Indeed"
 EVTNAME9502: "Wine"
 EVTDESC9502: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the land is very fertile and would be highly suitable for agricultural production of various types of staples but wine in particular."
 EVTOPTA9502: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9503: "Wool"
 EVTDESC9503: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area has perfect conditions for wool production. This is a rather valuable find considering that wool is the major raw material used for clothing."
 EVTOPTA9503: "That is good news"

 EVTOPTA9505: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9506: "Salt"
 EVTDESC9506: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area has a rich abundance of salt. This is a truly valuable find considering that salt is not only essential for human life but also one of the most common means to preserve food."
 EVTOPTA9506: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9507: "Naval Supplies"
 EVTDESC9507: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area would be very well suited for production of naval supplies, everything from basic wood to tar, ropes, linen and sails."
 EVTOPTA9507: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9508: "Copper"
 EVTDESC9508: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area is very rich in various metals but copper in particular. This is truly a valuable find considering copper's importance in cannon production."
 EVTOPTA9508: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9509: "Gold"
 EVTDESC9509: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area is very rich in various metals but gold in particular. Gold and silver being the basis of all formal currencies this is truly a valuable find."
 EVTOPTA9509: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME9510: "Iron"
 EVTDESC9510: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area is very rich in various metals but iron in particular. Iron forming the basis of the metallurgical industry this is truly a valuable find."
 EVTOPTA9510: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME9511: "Slaves"
 EVTDESC9511: "Slaves have been a trading commodity since Antiquity but lately the demand has increased rather drastically in part due to the large amount of plantations established in colonies like $PROVINCENAME$ and similar provinces."
 EVTOPTA9511: "Ok"
 EVTNAME9512: "Ivory"
 EVTOPTA9512: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME9513: "Tea"

 EVTNAME9514: "Chinaware"
 EVTDESC9514: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the area has perfect conditions for production of high value luxuries like chinaware."
 EVTOPTA9514: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME9515: "Spices"
 EVTDESC9515: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the land is immensely fertile and would serve extremely well for most kinds of spices like pepper, ginger, nutmeg, chilli or cinnamon."
 EVTOPTA9515: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME9516: "Coffee"
 EVTDESC9516: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the climate in combination with the province's fertile land makes it a highly suitable area for coffee production."

 EVTOPTA9519: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME2050: "The Counter-Reformation Ends"
 EVTDESC2050: "The Counter-Reformation no longer has the necessary support in $COUNTRY$, and thus has come to an end. The Pope is very disappointed."
 EVTOPTA2050: "Time to Move On"
 EVTDESC2051: "The Counter-Reformation served its purpose, but the era of religious strife in Europe is coming to an end."
 EVTDESC2052: "With our new ideas of every men being equal without regard for their religion, the Counter-Reformation has come to an end in our country."
 EVTDESC2053: "With our new ideas of religious tolerance towards heretics, the Counter-Reformation has come to an end in our country."
 EVTNAME9600: "Submission of the Clergy"
 EVTDESC9600: "A proposition has been made to restrict the Church's authority and right to formulate laws regarding church affairs without the king or queen's consent. Although centralizing the monarch's power may have its benefits this will also separate us further from the Roman church."
 EVTOPTA9600: "All power to the king"
 EVTOPTB9600: "Let the Clergy keep its authority"
 EVTNAME9520: "Abolition of Slavery"
 EVTDESC9520: "As slavery has been abolished in $COUNTRY$, all subjects, even in remote regions need to find another way to earn their living. Hopefully our traders can figure out another thing that is as profitable."
 EVTOPTA9520: "Let my people go!"
 EVTNAME9522: "Cocoa"
 EVTDESC9522: "We have received reports from our colonial settlers in $PROVINCENAME$ that the province's fertile land in combination with the province's hot, rainy tropical climate makes it a highly suitable area for cocoa production."
 EVTOPTA9522: "That is great news"
 EVTNAME610: "Integrating $FROMCOUNTRY$"
 EVTDESC610: "When a smaller country gives up its independence to join a greater realm, there is a lot of adapting, and while some parts are easy, the administration of the realm will still need to expand to accommodate all possibilities."
 EVTOPTB610A: "Integration is a slow process."
 EVTNAME9550: "Trade Focus"
 EVTDESC9550: "Some members of our parliament feel that we're not putting enough focus on national trade. It's pretty clear to everyone that we're not exactly dominating trade in this area but we could certainly do worse, at least that's what the other members are claiming. If our previous track record is anything to go by, our parliament are not very likely to come to any sort of agreement anytime soon unless someone is able to talk some sense into them."
 EVTOPTA9550: "We need more merchants"
 EVTOPTB9550: "It's efficiency we lack"
 EVTNAME9551: "Trade Expansion"
 EVTOPTA9551: "Local trade is where our focus should be"
 EVTOPTB9551: "Perhaps it's time to broaden our horizons"
 EVTNAME9552: "Budgetary Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9552: "Our parliament seems to have some real difficulties coming to terms with how to govern our nation, whether it's agreeing on a budget, taxes, port duties or trade and customs policies. This time it's the budget, should more money be invested into research or be set aside for unforeseen expenses in the future?"
 EVTOPTA9552: "Invest it all in research"
 EVTOPTB9552: "Save some for future expenses"
 EVTNAME9553: "Disagreements in the Parliament"
 EVTOPTA9553: "Try to mediate between the two parties"
 EVTOPTB9553: "Propose some other changes"
 EVTNAME9554: "Misdirected Focus"
 EVTDESC9554: "A few members of our parliament are convinced that we're putting too much focus on military operations instead of concentrating on expanding our trade. They are complaining that too many investments are being directed into financing our military but almost nothing to improve our trade conditions."
 EVTOPTA9554: "It's all according to plan"
 EVTOPTB9554: "Perhaps our focus has been a bit misdirected"
 EVTNAME9555: "Parliamentary Problems"
 EVTDESC9555: "$STATESMAN$ has been quite busy lately, proposing new changes, one after the other. Although you could argue that they are only doing their job, their constant interference and attitude of 'knowing it all' in any matter even remotely related to politics is causing quite a rift in our parliament, there are even those that think we would do better without $STATESMAN$."
 EVTOPTA9555: "Find someone to replace $STATESMAN_S_PRONOUN$."
 EVTOPTB9555: "Give the advisor another chance"
 EVTNAME9556: "Heated Debates"
 EVTDESC9556: "Some members of the parliament are having some concerns regarding our increasingly bad reputation, they are claiming that it's having a negative effect on our trade relations. This question has been raised numerous times in the past but not that many have thought it of any consequence. This time the matter is causing some really heated debates though, perhaps we should try to settle things before they get out of hand."
 EVTOPTA9556: "That is probably wise"
 EVTOPTB9556: "It's not really a problem"
 EVTNAME9557: "Offense or Defense"
 EVTDESC9557: "The ongoing war has led to some serious conflicts in parliament. On the one side there are those arguing that there is nothing to be gained by allowing the war to drag on while others are convinced that there's no turning back. Unfortunately their inability to come to some sort of agreement does nothing to improve our current situation but rather the contrary."
 EVTOPTA9557: "Offense is probably the only option"
 EVTOPTB9557: "Defense sounds better at this stage"
 EVTNAME9558: "Conflicting Opinions"
 EVTDESC9558: "It seems there is always a small group of the parliament that can't agree with the others. Regardless of the matter at hand this particular group always have a different opinion than everyone else."
 EVTOPTA9558: "It's probably best to leave things as they are"
 EVTOPTB9558: "Some restructuring might be needed"
 EVTNAME9559: "An infiltrator in Parliament"
 EVTDESC9559: "There is a spy among us! Somehow a spy has managed to infiltrate our parliament and all of a sudden everyone is a suspect. We haven't managed to find out who sent him yet but since our relations with some of our neighbors are somewhat strained at the moment it was probably one of them."
 EVTOPTA9559: "That's not possible"
 EVTOPTB9559: "That's the only reasonable explanation"
 EVTNAME9560: "A Traitor in the Parliament"
 EVTDESC9560: "It would appear as though a member of our parliament has been selling secrets to our enemies. How would you otherwise explain the fact that they all of a sudden seem able to predict our every move? These were decisions that were never discussed outside the Parliament building."
 EVTOPTA9560: "Of course it was one of them"
 EVTOPTB9560: "It's better to play it safe until we know more"
 EVTNAME9561: "Political Chaos"
 EVTDESC9561: "Our Parliament's indecisiveness and inability to make any kind of decision has created near chaos. Every member is trying their utmost to get their voice heard but refusing to acknowledge the opinions of anyone else."
 EVTOPTA9561: "That's just the nature of politics"
 EVTOPTB9561: "Some restructuring might be necessary"
 EVTNAME9562: "Influenced Decisions"
 EVTDESC9562: "It has been brought to your attention that a certain member of our Parliament has been accepting bribes from several different sources for influencing all kinds of national decisions."
 EVTOPTA9562: "It has to stop"
 EVTOPTB9562: "That can't be true"
 EVTNAME9563: "Financial Disagreements"
 EVTDESC9563: "Our economy isn't what it has been. The treasury is almost empty and our parliament can't seem to figure out how to handle the situation or the reasons for it to happen in the first place. Minting more money is always an option of course or raising taxes, either way they are waiting for you to make a decision."
 EVTOPTA9563: "Mint more money"
 EVTOPTB9563: "Raise taxes"
 EVTNAME9564: "Military Spending"
 EVTDESC9564: "Some members of parliament are complaining that we're spending too much money on our military. Many of them are convinced that our production and trade will suffer if we don't cut back on military expenses."
 EVTOPTA9564: "Well, trade and production aren't as important"
 EVTOPTB9564: "Cut back on military expenses"
 EVTNAME9565: "A Strong Army or Navy?"
 EVTDESC9565: "Our Parliament is divided in regards to our military focus, some of them are advocating for a grand navy while others are more interested in a large army. Although some sort of middle way would be possible, most of them would prefer that we increased the size of our navy."
 EVTOPTA9565: "A large navy is the only option"
 EVTOPTB9565: "A large army would be more beneficial"
 EVTNAME9566: "Military Leniency"
 EVTDESC9566: "Some members of our parliament feel that we are too lenient when it comes to asserting control over what is rightfully ours. They can't understand how we can allow a core province like $PROVINCENAME$ to be controlled by some other country and just sit idly by."
 EVTOPTA9566: "They fail to see the bigger picture"
 EVTOPTB9566: "It's not of any interest anymore"
 EVTNAME9567: "Too many liberties"
 EVTDESC9567: "A few members of our parliament are of the opinion that $MONARCH$ has been taking a few too many liberties lately when it comes to governing our nation. Some are even claiming that $MONARCH$ seem to lack any respect whatsoever for both the constitution and the rest of the parliament."
 EVTOPTA9567: "They are exaggerating"
 EVTOPTB9567: "Take appropriate measurements"
 EVTNAME9568: "Economic Decisions"
 EVTDESC9568: "Our parliament is constantly exploring different ways to bring more money into our state treasury but as always there are disagreements regarding the best strategy. A heavy tax raise would improve the state of our treasury considerably but it is also very likely to upset the populace, a small raise on the other hand wouldn't improve our finances as much but wouldn't cause that many protests either."
 EVTOPTA9568: "A short-term solution is probably the best option"
 EVTOPTB9568: "Consider the long-term consequences"
 EVTNAME9569: "Military Expenses"
 EVTDESC9569: "Several members of our parliament are complaining that the costs of maintaining such a large army are too big for our current budget."
 EVTOPTA9569: "Convince them that we can afford it"
 EVTOPTB9569: "Agree to make some cutbacks"
 EVTNAME9570: "Sympathizers of the Old Government"
 EVTDESC9570: "It would appear as though a few members of our parliament still sympathize with the former government. Neither of them will admit it of course, but their behavior is rather suspicious at times. It might be a good idea to investigate where their real allegiances lay."
 EVTOPTA9570: "That won't be necessary"
 EVTOPTB9570: "Get to it"
 EVTNAME9571: "A New Constitution"
 EVTDESC9571: "Despite the considerable time and effort dedicated to the establishment of a new constitution, our parliament can't seem to agree on a common goal. So far, not a single proposition has been accepted by all parties and all normal activities have come to a standstill."
 EVTOPTA9571: "It will be solved soon enough"
 EVTOPTB9571: "Request some help"
 EVTNAME9572: "Areas of Research"
 EVTDESC9572: "Every member of our parliament is requesting more money to be invested in a different area. Our army needs funding but so does our trade and production and let's not forget about our navy."
 EVTOPTA9572: "An even spread should do the trick"
 EVTOPTB9572: "There's no need for any extra investments"
 EVTNAME9573: "Lack of Support"
 EVTDESC9573: "Some members of our parliament seem to think that $MONARCH$ has held his office long enough and are arguing for a new election. Apparently the reason for this is grounded in a disagreement they had with $MONARCH$ a short while ago regarding the implementation of a new financial reform."
 EVTOPTA9573: "Ignore them"
 EVTOPTB9573: "Agree to hear them out once more"
 EVTNAME9574: "Anxious Parliament"
 EVTDESC9574: "$SPYMASTER$, always being a rather suspicious person, has managed to convince several members of parliament that a plot to launch a counter-revolution is under way. $SPYMASTER_CAP_ADJ$ doesn't have any real evidence so far, but most members seem to take $SPYMASTER_S_PRONOUN$ seriously and are therefore demanding appropriate measures to be taken."
 EVTOPTA9574: "It's nothing to worry about"
 EVTOPTB9574: "It's better to be safe than sorry"
 EVTNAME9575: "Troublesome Parliament"
 EVTDESC9575: "Our parliament seems to have some difficulties understanding who's in charge of our government. They seem to think it's fully acceptable to make decisions without either informing or discussing the matter with you first. Whatever gave them that idea?"
 EVTOPTA9575: "Make it a bit more clear to them"
 EVTOPTB9575: "Let them think they have a say in things"
 EVTNAME9576: "Overspending"
 EVTDESC9576: "$TREASURER$ has been complaining constantly for the last few weeks that we're spending more money than our budget allows. $TREASURER_CAP_ADJ$ has always been a bit overdramatic of course but this time $TREASURER_ADJ$ has even managed to convince some of the other members of parliament that it's a real problem."
 EVTOPTA9576: "Try to convince $TREASURER_O_PRONOUN$ otherwise"
 EVTOPTB9576: "Let $TREASURER_O_PRONOUN$ worry"
 EVTNAME9577: "Embezzlement"
 EVTDESC9577: "It's becoming more and more clear to you that there aren't that many members of the parliament that you can really trust. One of your closest advisors has just been exposed stealing money from the state treasury."
 EVTOPTA9577: "There's probably a good explanation for this"
 EVTOPTB9577: "Get rid of them"
 EVTNAME9578: "Planned Coup"
 EVTDESC9578: "According to some fairly trustworthy sources a few members of parliament are planning a coup to have $MONARCH$ replaced. It might be wise to investigate the matter further."
 EVTOPTA9578: "You can never be too careful"
 EVTOPTB9578: "They wouldn't dare!"
 EVTNAME9579: "Possible Traitors"
 EVTDESC9579: "There are some rumors floating around that certain members of our parliament are actually spies sent by a rivaling nation to infiltrate our government. Apparently you can't trust anyone."
 EVTOPTA9579: "Confront them"
 EVTOPTB9579: "Send a few spies of your own"
 EVTNAME1083: "Lacking Support"
 EVTDESC1083: "For reasons unknown, some of the cardinals have begun to question your decisions more and more lately, it almost seems like they are beginning to lose faith in your ability to govern the Catholic Church."
 EVTOPTA1083: "Hire someone to investigate the matter"
 EVTOPTB1083: "Just try to prove them wrong"
 EVTNAME1084: "Possible Infiltrator"
 EVTDESC1084: "According to one of your closest advisors, a spy has managed to infiltrate the Sacred College of Cardinals. Unless you think you can trust the advisor, perhaps you should ask them to provide you with some evidence?"
 EVTOPTA1084: "Take their word for it"
 EVTOPTB1084: "Ask for some proof"
 EVTNAME1090: "Too Much Religious Freedom"
 EVTDESC1090: "One of your advisors has asked you to consider the matter of religious freedom a bit more thoroughly. They are claiming that having a large group of people that doesn't adhere to our state religion is having a severe impact on our national stability."
 EVTOPTA1090: "Take their advice under consideration"
 EVTOPTB1090: "It's not of any consequence"
 EVTNAME1091: "Problematic Relations"
 EVTDESC1091: "It has become a real issue for you that some of your neighbors refuse to accept the one true faith. Your relations are already far from ideal but this only makes matters worse."
 EVTOPTA1091: "Make your opinion clear to them"
 EVTOPTB1091: "Make preparations for a future attack"
 EVTNAME2060: "Missionary Falls Ill"
 EVTDESC2060: "The missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$ hasn't had much luck so far, news have just reached us that he has fallen ill. Any further work on the new church has come to a standstill and without his guidance the chances of converting the locals are rather slim."
 EVTOPTA2060: "Send someone to assist him"
 EVTOPTB2060: "Direct your efforts elsewhere"
 EVTNAME2061: "Religious Resistance"
 EVTDESC2061: "It is proving much harder than anticipated to convert the citizens of $PROVINCENAME$. Although a few of them showed some clear interest in the beginning, the majority don't seem that willing to embrace a new religion."
 EVTOPTA2061: "Increase your efforts"
 EVTOPTB2061: "It's a waste of time"
 EVTNAME2062: "Native Attack"
 EVTDESC2062: "We have just received news regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the report he and his followers were attacked by natives just a short while ago. Unfortunately it's not clear if they managed to drive the attackers away or if they still pose a threat."
 EVTOPTA2062: "Send some troops and supplies just in case"
 EVTOPTB2062: "They can probably handle this themselves"
 EVTNAME2063: "Religious Uproar"
 EVTDESC2063: "According to the governor of $PROVINCENAME$, the citizens are in uproar because of our missionaries' complete lack of respect for any religious practices or traditions different from their own. He is asking us to consider canceling all further missionary activities in the area or at least send some more troops until things calm down a bit."
 EVTOPTA2063: "Send some troops"
 EVTOPTB2063: "It's not of much importance"
 EVTNAME2064: "Wicked Rumors"
 EVTDESC2064: "There are some very disturbing rumors circulating regarding the missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$. According to the rumors he never used the money we gave him to finance the construction of a new church but kept it all to himself. Who would have thought such a godly man could be capable of such a thing."
 EVTOPTA2064: "Find out if it's true"
 EVTOPTB2064: "There's no reason to doubt a man of god"
 EVTNAME2065: "Religious Tensions"
 EVTDESC2065: "The situation in $PROVINCENAME$ is getting close to unbearable. The citizens are refusing to accept the preaching of the missionary we sent there a short while ago and now he fears for his life. A revolt seems imminent unless we do something soon."
 EVTOPTA2065: "Take your chances"
 EVTOPTB2065: "Do what you can"
 EVTNAME2066: "Neighbor Disrupting the Peace"
 EVTDESC2066: "The missionary we sent to $PROVINCENAME$ is complaining that the area is too unstable at the moment. Despite our neutral stance, the war that is currently going on in the neighboring country is having an impact on $PROVINCENAME$ too."
 EVTOPTA2066: "Offer him some more money"
 EVTOPTB2066: "Offer him some help"
 EVTOPTC2066: "Don't worry about it"
 EVTNAME2067: "Missionary Activities"
 EVTDESC2067: "Our theologian is complaining that not enough money is invested in missionary activities. One missionary is hardly enough to convert the whole population of $PROVINCENAME$ for instance."
 EVTOPTA2067: "Perhaps he's right"
 EVTOPTB2067: "It's more than enough"
 EVTNAME1420: "Founding Father in $PROVINCENAME$."
 EVTDESC1420: "There is a gentleman in [Root.GetName] preaching to the people that their home would be better off free from the ?gclutches of [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] imperialism?h and that the entirety of the region should embrace self-governance. While many regarded him at first as a harmless nuisance, the number of followers he?fs gained is rapidly growing, and some members of our government worry that eventually, this ?gfounding father?h will incite a violent rebellion in [Root.GetName] in an attempt to break away from the [Root.Owner.GetAdjective] Empire."
 EVTOPTA1420: "He can't do any harm"
 EVTOPTB1420: "Execute him"
 EVTNAME1421: "A Firebrand Preacher stirs up $PROVINCENAME$"
 EVTDESC1421: "An illiterate preacher who doesn't seem to understand basic scripture is preaching a message that contradicts Christ's true message about showing complete subservience to our regime, no matter how tyrannical. His blatant and deliberate misinterpretation of the Bible is stirring up controversy amongst the devout of [Root.GetName] and turning the people against the good [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Owner.Monarch.GetName]!"
 EVTOPTA1421: "And the people listen to him..."

Her eyes are green, her hair is black, and your eyes are drawn to the painting as if to a vacuum. A cunning smile find its way to your advisor's face. The noise of the room dies down. You do not know how long you stand there looking. She is beautiful."
 EVTOPTA9486: "I must have her!"
 EVTOPTB9486: "What is this foul witchcraft? Begone!"
 EVTNAME9487: "A thorn from a foreign land"
 EVTDESC9487: "While the poor quality of the painting might explain away some of it, the fact remains that The Creator was not being overly generous when he endowed this girl with her looks. The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ has offered her hand in marriage, and you are not sure if you should laugh or feel insulted. Then again, there is the succession to consider."
 EVTOPTA9487: "A good $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ woman, I'm sure."
 EVTOPTB9487: "This will obviously not do."
 EVTNAME9488: "The Aftermath"
 EVTDESC9488: "'Our last war was an abject failure, and you know it!', the anger in your heir's voice is unmistakable. True, mistakes were made during the war, but all of them were hardly yours. Besides, $HEIRNAME$ also commanded troops. 'I believe it is time for you to retire.' 'The audacity...'"
 EVTOPTA9488: "I accept responsibility"
 EVTOPTB9488: "I will not be met with insolence in my own house!"
 EVTNAME9489: "$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Moon"
 EVTDESC9489: "The garden is bathed in the cool light of a full moon. Turning a corner to come across this sight was not what you had expected, but here it is. Before you stands a monument to $RANDOM_OLD_WAR$. The beauty lies not in the exquisite marble, or even in the craftsmanship of the thing, but in the fact that even now, many years later, the monument is still strewn with thousands and thousands of fresh flowers. Here, if nowhere else, the memory of $RANDOM_OLD_WAR$, and the memories of the fallen, still lives."
 EVTOPTA9489: "May the memory live on"
 EVTOPTB9489: "Our sorrow proves the justness of our cause."
 EVTNAME9490: "Seeing The Real You"
 EVTDESC9490: "She turns around. She looks at you. - 'Have you prayed lately, $MONARCH$?' The question underscores the distance between you that, for the past year, has been growing. - 'I think you should. I do. Almost every night.' You laugh. For all her human flaws she is still your wife. She draws closer, the hint of a smile spreading across her face. - 'What are you laughing at, $MONARCH$'?"
 EVTOPTA9490: "I just realized how much you mean to me."
 EVTOPTB9490: "The economy is doing laughably good! Haha!"
 EVTNAME3097: "Rebel Uprising!"
 EVTDESC3097: "With traitor armies raising their flags in rebellion across our empire, rebels in [jackals_and_vultures_province.GetName] think they can smell blood in the water and have joined the other malcontents in revolt."
 EVTOPTA3097: "Jackals! Vultures!"
 EVTNAME9492: "Our Monarch Dies"
 EVTDESC9492: "Our monarch has died, and considering the strange things he was saying toward the end of his life, perhaps it is for the better."
 EVTOPTA9492: "God bless his soul"
 EVTNAME3098: "$LIKELYREBELS$ Sentiment"
 EVTDESC3098: "With our reputation, our neighbors think we are the spawn of the Devil and are all plotting our downfall. $LIKELYREBELS$ conspirators are spreading lies and igniting rebel sentiment in $PROVINCENAME$..."
 EVTOPTA3098: "A minor inconvenience"
 EVTNAME6006: "City-State Wants Independence"

 EVTNAME6018: "Civil War Brings our Nation to its Knees"
 EVTDESC6018: "The Civil War has tormented our nation for far too long. The chaos is consuming all our energy, weakening us and making us easy prey for our enemies. Drastic measures will be necessary if we are to restore our nation's prominence and put an end to the infighting before it is too late."
 EVTOPTA6018: "There is nothing we can do."
 EVTOPTB6018: "Do whatever is needed to restore order."
 EVTOPTC6018: "Surely we can bribe off some of our opponents."
 EVTNAME6019: "The Chaos of the Civil War Multiplies"
 EVTDESC6019: "It seems there is no end to the instability! Even our most loyal supporters now threaten to abandon us unless we change course and bow to their demands. We must take action quickly, lest we allow [Root.GetUsableName] to be overwhelmed by chaos."
 EVTOPTA6019: "We shall fight them in battle!"
 EVTOPTB6019: "Grant concessions, we cannot risk losing their support."
 EVTNAME6020: "The Opposition Factions"
 EVTDESC6020: "In the midst of the ongoing chaos, small but powerful factions have emerged, each of them trying to gain the upper hand by swaying important nobles from our court to side with them and their cause. Some are violently opposed to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], but others could be brought over to our side if granted sufficient concessions."
 EVTOPTA6020: "Offer the moderates concessions."
 EVTOPTB6020: "Don't support any faction."
 EVTNAME6021: "Faction Requests Financial Aid"
 EVTDESC6021: "The moderates whose support we have enlisted in our struggle against the rebels lack the funds to sustain the war against the rebels. They ask for financial support to keep up the struggle and help us put an end to the turmoil."
 EVTOPTA6021: "Lend support."
 EVTOPTB6021: "Ignore their pleas."
 EVTNAME6022: "Dissentions among our Supporters"
 EVTDESC6022: "Disputes have emerged among the moderates whose support we had enlisted. It seems that not all of them are happy with the deal they struck with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An individual of [rebel_province.Culture.GetName] origin, who has managed to gain considerable influence in the moderate faction, is calling for greater autonomy for his people, threatening to join the rebels if we refuse his demands."
 EVTOPTA6022: "We don't need his support."
 EVTOPTB6022: "Side with one of the new factions."
 EVTOPTC6022: "Give in to his demands."
 EVTNAME6023: "Civil War Becomes Total War"
 EVTDESC6023: "What initially began as minor clashes between different factions supporting or opposing the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has turned into pure mayhem. Unless we can turn things around fast, our nation will likely crumble before our eyes."
 EVTOPTA6023: "We can't do anything about it."
 EVTOPTB6023: "Try to suppress the worst spots."
 EVTNAME6024: "Chaos in Neighboring Country"
 EVTDESC6024: "The chaos that has engulfed our neighbor is slowly creeping closer to our own borders. You would think that they would be able to handle their own petty problems but apparently that is not the case. Should we try to help them?"
 EVTOPTA6024: "We can't afford to help them"
 EVTOPTB6024: "Secure our own borders"
 EVTOPTC6024: "Secure our own borders and send aid"
 EVTNAME6025: "Our Country has Splintered Apart"
 EVTDESC6025: "The strong disagreement between different political groups has splintered our nation into several smaller fragments. Unification seems unlikely at the moment but we shouldn't give up so easily."
 EVTOPTA6025: "It's over, let them go"
 EVTOPTB6025: "Consolidate our forces and forget about them"
 EVTOPTC6025: "We will have our revenge someday"

 EVTOPTB6026: "Negotiate a settlement between all major factions."
 EVTNAME6027: "Negotiations Break Down"

 EVTNAME6028: "War Ends with Negotiated Peace"

 EVTNAME710: "Complaints about [Root.GetLowLevelOfficialForCountry]"
 EVTDESC710: "Our [Root.GetLowLevelOfficialForCountry] in [bailiff_province.GetName] has earned a reputation as a greedy and cruel person. The local populace have gathered to petition to have him removed."

 EVTNAME711: "Priests are preaching Heresy!"
 EVTDESC711: "Rumors has reached us of several priests in [heresy_province.GetName] who have been preaching a heresy which is clearly against our one true faith. The local populace seem to follow their words, something which may become troublesome in the future."
 EVTOPTA711: "Ignore the Heresy."
 EVTOPTB711: "Crack down on it!"
 EVTNAME712: "Dramatic Currency Revaluation"
 EVTDESC712: "Concerned about spiraling inflation, your government strongly advises you to abandon the old coinage and begin using a new, more stable currency. While beneficial in the long run, this would immediately cause severe unrest in your country, along with a loss of prestige."
 EVTOPTA712: "Heed this advice."
 EVTOPTB712: "Who cares about the economy?"
 EVTNAME713: "Decadence"
 EVTDESC713: "The peace and prosperity our country is experiencing at the moment has allowed the people to relax and feel happy and secure. This is something they could grow used to... so much so that the hardships of the past are increasingly unimaginable, and people are generally becoming lazier and less productive over time."
 EVTOPTA713: "We needed a shakeup."
 EVTNAME714: "Military Divided!"
 EVTDESC714: "Opposing factions in the military are advocating different tactics. We need to back one of them, to end the bickering."

 EVTNAME715: "$MONARCH$ embarrasses the court"

 EVTOPTA715: "Blame the $MONARCHTITLE$"
 EVTNAME716: "Nobles Demand Recompensation"
 EVTDESC716: "The state has lived off the contributions of the nobles for a long period of the time. Now the country is doing well, so the nobility is eager to get their cut of the cake."
 EVTOPTA716: "Ignore them!"
 EVTOPTB716: "Very well, pay them off."
 EVTNAME717: "Monetary Reforms"
 EVTDESC717: "Our treasurers are arguing that we need to enact some reforms in our economic policies. A new master of mint will also be needed to take care of the economy."
 EVTOPTA717: "Enact them!"
 EVTOPTB717: "There is no need for reforms."
 EVTNAME718: "The Fortunes of War"
 EVTDESC718: "Our realm has been ravaged by war, and the people, from the highest noble down to the poorest serf, are tired of it. We need to enact some temporary laws to let our country recover quicker."
 EVTOPTA718: "Enact strong laws."
 EVTOPTB718: "Be more lenient."
 EVTNAME719: "Strong Military Leadership"
 EVTDESC719: "Our recent wars have given the rise to competent leaders, even from the peasant stock. We could prosper from their skills, or we could reject them as they, after all, are not noble. Accepting them may upset factions in our country though."
 EVTOPTA719: "$COUNTRY$ needs them all!"
 EVTOPTB719: "Restrict the non-nobility."
 EVTNAME720: "The Naval Tradition"
 EVTDESC720: "The only thing that can truly create a good commander at sea is the experience of being at sea. Competent people can be promoted, and this is what creates a strong navy. However, some factions in the country truly dislike such egalitarianism."
 EVTOPTA720: "A cabin boy can become Captain!"
 EVTOPTB720: "Never!"
 EVTNAME722: "Sickness of $MONARCHTITLE$"

 EVTOPTB723: "Give them more local authority."
 EVTOPTC723: "Reform Society"
 EVTNAME724: "Clergy condemns a philosopher as heretic!"

 EVTOPTA724: "Support Clergy"
 EVTOPTB724: "Support Philosopher"
 EVTNAME725: "Growth of Cities attracts Serfs"
 EVTDESC725: "It seems as if serfs are moving out of the provinces and aim to earn a living in the capital. This is creating turmoil in the country, but our capital may benefit in the long run."
 EVTOPTA725: "We have to accept this."
 EVTOPTB725: "The serfs belong on their turf."
 EVTNAME726: "$MONARCHTITLE$'s reputation tarnished!"

 EVTNAME800: "Noble Uprising"

 EVTOPTB800A: "Very well, crush them!"
 EVTNAME801: "Loss of Prestige"
 EVTDESC801: "Strengthening the burghers and merchants at the cost of the gentry lessens our prestige in the eyes of the world. We are losing face, and risk becoming a nation of greedy moneygrubbers."
 EVTOPTB801A: "What do we care?"
 EVTNAME802: "Merchants Benefit"
 EVTDESC802: "When the position of burghers and merchants is strengthened in a country, there will be more competent people available for state duty. Sometimes a country can benefit even from the talents of the common folk."
 EVTOPTB802A: "One Great Man will serve us!"
 EVTNAME803: "Loss of Stability"
 EVTDESC803: "This strengthening of the privileges of the nobles is severely upsetting the burghers and merchants. This is creating turmoil in our realm, and may prove disastrous in the long run."
 EVTOPTA803: "Well, they are just peasants."
 EVTNAME804: "The Burghers Rise!"
 EVTDESC804: "The Burghers are rising against the changes in our country, which have limited their powers. Clearly, they are not happy with having the privileges of the nobility strengthened."
 EVTOPTB804A: "Rely on the Nobility."
 EVTNAME805: "More Nobility in the Army"
 EVTDESC805: "With the increased privileges of the aristocracy come additional duties. A true nobleman is expected to serve in the army as an officer and a gentleman."
 EVTOPTB805A: "A Noble can always lead."
 EVTNAME806: "Country Destabilized"
 EVTDESC806: "Our decision to strengthen the state at the cost of regional interests has left a bit of a gap in local politics. Since there are no local potentates to tell them everything is fine, the people have started to believe they are being badly governed."
 EVTOPTB806A: "Unfortunate"
 EVTNAME807: "Large Revolt"
 EVTDESC807: "Although we are well aware that no one likes paying taxes, you would think that people would have the sense to realize that glorious victories on the battlefield require a little more taxation. It seems we will have to explain it to them."
 EVTOPTB807A: "Target practice"
 EVTNAME808: "Local Pretender Rises"
 EVTDESC808: "In order to ensure the glory of our country we have had to restrict local privileges. The problem with privileges is that people get very attached to them for sentimental reasons. Now, some power-hungry idiot has declared himself the true ruler of our country, and many hopefuls flock to his banner because he has promised to restore local privileges."
 EVTOPTB808A: "Off with his head!"
 EVTNAME809: "Local Tax Increase"
 EVTDESC809: "One of our [Root.GetLowLevelOfficialForCountry] has skillfully used his authority to increase the tax base in his province."
 EVTOPTB809A: "Excellent work"
 EVTNAME810: "More Local Recruiting"
 EVTDESC810: "Our decision to ensure that local privileges will be honored has meant that peasants are keen to defend their villages. This in turn has the added benefit of people being less resentful about serving in our military."
 EVTOPTB810A: "We are pleased"
 EVTNAME811: "Stability Increase"
 EVTDESC811: "Our decision to give more power to local magnates has ensured that people of importance feel good about our government. So, they have been telling everyone else how well they are being governed."
 EVTOPTB811A: "Good news"
 EVTNAME812: "Peasant Revolt"
 EVTDESC812: "One of the good things about serfdom is that by ensuring that peasants cannot move around they become easier to tax. However, some peasants seem to have issues with this just and natural policy, so they have foolishly decided to revolt."
 EVTOPTB812A: "Kill them All!"
 EVTNAME813: "Attracting the right people"
 EVTDESC813: "By assisting our nobles in confining the serfs to their lands we have greatly enriched the landed aristocracy. A wealthy nobility is one that can devote time to life's higher pursuits and the lesser sons of any house of respect will count a great number of loyal and able artists, administrators or other men of quality among their scions. Some are quite eager to pay the state back for the service it has done to their families."
 EVTOPTB813A: "This is good"
 EVTNAME814: "Major Revolt"
 EVTDESC814: "Our Peasants are deeply upset at the news that their freedom of movement is to be further restricted. In fact, there have been massive revolts across our country because of this... Perhaps if they took the time to care for their personal hygiene they would not be so revolting? "
 EVTOPTB814A: "The peasants are revolting!"
 EVTNAME815: "People are disappearing"
 EVTDESC815: "Since we have made it easier for the peasants to move around in search of better farming opportunities, it has, unfortunately, been more difficult to track them down when the army needs recruits."
 EVTOPTA815: "Not ideal this"
 EVTNAME816: "Losing control"
 EVTDESC816: "With our new laws that tie the peasantry less firmly to the land, it seems that they are also getting strange new ideas about their precise role in the grand scheme of things."
 EVTOPTB816A: "This is a worrying development"
 EVTNAME817: "Better Administration"
 EVTDESC817: "By reining in the nobility in their ruthless exploitation of the peasantry, so called 'gentleman farmers' have become surprisingly common in the administration. This, in turn, has improved general conditions in our country."
 EVTOPTB817A: "Progress!"
 EVTNAME818: "Dangerous ideas are spreading!"
 EVTDESC818: "Our slightly less dogmatic thinking has led to new and strange notions of 'humanism'. This is a cause for deep concern, since people are starting to question the proper order of things."
 EVTOPTB818A: "We are concerned."
 EVTNAME819: "We look weak"
 EVTDESC819: "Properly civilized countries do not allow petty commoners to attempt any kind of serious thought. The eyes of the world are upon us, and the world does not like what it sees."
 EVTOPTB819A: "It is temporary"
 EVTNAME820: "New thinkers arise"
 EVTDESC820: "Our generous policies allowing people more freedom of speech have created a fertile breeding ground for promising new ideas. Some of the prominent new thinkers might become great men, who will eventually leave our nation with a lasting legacy of intellectual growth."
 EVTOPTB820A: "We have chosen wisely"
 EVTNAME821: "Heresy"
 EVTDESC821: "Somehow, it seems like for every nest of heretics we root out and purge, another two spring up."
 EVTOPTB821A: "Weeds in the garden..."
 EVTNAME822: "Disorder"
 EVTDESC822: "Not everybody agrees with our religious doctrine. Some people are complaining loudly, calling our approach to modern ideas narrow-minded and arguing that clinging to ancient philosophy is regressive nonsense."
 EVTOPTB822A: "Alas, some might have to burn..."
 EVTNAME823: "A Holy Person Has Arrived"
 EVTDESC823: "A person from a holy order arrived at court today, impressed with our harsh, but just and Godly, punishment of heretics and unbelievers. They have asked for an advisory position, stating that a [Root.GovernmentName] that prays together will stay together."
 EVTOPTB823A: "Let me think about this."
 EVTNAME830: "Nobles are worried"
 EVTDESC830: "Our nobles with estates close to the frontier are concerned that we are neglecting our defenses. They have voiced their worries to all and sundry."
 EVTOPTB830A: "But attack is the best form of defense!"
 EVTNAME831: "Too many cowards"
 EVTDESC831: "Our increasing focus on offensive doctrine has made it harder to find brave peasants to fill the ranks. Ridiculous complaints about being cannon fodder are frequently spouted to our recruitment officers."
 EVTOPTB831A: "The fools are missing out on glory"
 EVTNAME832: "Glory to us"
 EVTDESC832: "Our decision to focus on offense has led too many of our neighbors looking enviously and worriedly at our glorious troops, who stand ready to give our enemies a taste of cold steel."
 EVTOPTB832A: "Indeed"
 EVTNAME833: "Aristocrats don't want to serve"
 EVTDESC833: "Our Aristocrats are becoming reluctant to serve in our army since we are focusing on defensive tactics. They are concerned about the lack of opportunities for glory while cowering behind fortifications."
 EVTOPTB833A: "They just don't understand"
 EVTOPTB833B: "A little gold will convince them"
 EVTNAME834: "Peasants upset"
 EVTDESC834: "With our increasing focus on defense, we have been clearing land around our fortifications to dig moats and create clear fields of fire. The people occupying some of the land have reacted in a most disloyal manner."
 EVTOPTB834A: "Well, the fort should hold out till relief arrives."
 EVTNAME835: "Fortification Expert"
 EVTDESC835: "Since we have started to focus on more defensive philosophies, a humble engineer (a position usually at the bottom of the rung in the military) has had a chance to impress with the mark of true genius."
 EVTOPTB835A: "He is pretty good I guess..."
 ideagroups.802.b: "Let him improve defenses in his home province."
 EVTNAME836: "Naval thought suffering"
 EVTDESC836: "With our attention shifting further from the Navy to the Army, some of our master shipwrights have decided to seek employment elsewhere. This has caused our shipyards to suffer."
 EVTOPTB836A: "To be expected"
 EVTNAME837: "Naval Officers are retiring"
 EVTDESC837: "Our decision to start favoring the Army more has led to a crop of promising young naval officers to retire from service. They claim that there are not as many opportunities for advancement as there used to be."
 EVTOPTB837A: "Damn"
 EVTNAME838: "An example to us all"
 EVTDESC838: "As the Army is starting to enjoy the fruits of our increased favor, many young officers are looking for opportunities to distinguish themselves. One captain in particular stands out - he even cuts a striking figure!"
 EVTOPTB838A: "Interesting."
 EVTNAME839: "Arsenals are being deserted"
 EVTDESC839: "Since we have decided to increase our focus on naval matters, our military arsenals supplying the Army are being deserted. Experienced craftsmen are seeking employment elsewhere."
 EVTOPTB839A: "Disappointing"
 EVTNAME840: "General retires"
 EVTDESC840: "The recent decision to favor the Navy more has caused several generals to seek retirement. They feel that there will be less glory for them."
 EVTOPTB840A: "Oh well"
 EVTNAME842: "Unsuitable recruits"
 EVTDESC842: "Since we have felt it necessary to tighten up the quality standards of our army, a whole host of potential recruits must regrettably be declared unfit for duty."
 EVTOPTB842A: "We must separate the wheat from the chaff "
 EVTNAME843: "[Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] worried"
 EVTDESC843: "With our army increasingly focused on quality, there are concerns that the traditional army - loyal to them first and the country second - is gone forever. Fortunately, they are even more worried that this new model army will prove a most compelling argument against any overly loud complaints... [Root.GetNoblesReplacementForOtherGovernments] are especially worried that their positions may be threatened."
 EVTOPTB843A: "There is nothing to worry about"
 EVTNAME844: "New commandant"
 EVTDESC844: "Since we are looking for a more disciplined army, our commandants are working hard at making sure our troops are drilled to perfection. One man in particular shows real promise."
 EVTOPTB844A: "Very Good"
 EVTNAME845: "People laugh at our army"
 EVTDESC845: "Although the decision to go for a massed army makes sense to many inside our country, uncouth foreigners are laughing at us, saying our army is nothing but an undisciplined mob."
 EVTOPTB845A: "Let them laugh."
 EVTNAME846: "Leaders harder to find"
 EVTDESC846: "We have made the wise decision to favor quantity over quality. However, the new larger army has the unforeseen problem of finding it harder to spot officers of talent among the masses."
 EVTOPTB846A: "Things will no doubt improve"
 EVTNAME847: "New organization"
 EVTDESC847: "Some thought that our decision to favor quantity over quality was foolish, that it would lead to a decline in leadership, or even make our army a bit of a joke - but they were wrong. Our new larger army has unlocked the talents of our military minds, leading to ever better levels of organization."
 EVTOPTB847A: "Nice "
 EVTNAME729: "Improve the Capital"
 EVTDESC729: "The glory of our capital has long been neglected. We now have an opportunity to improve the city and make it a beacon of cultural pride. This may prove costly, but there is an alternative solution."
 EVTOPTA729: "Use the Military as Workforce"
 EVTOPTB729: "Spend Money"
 EVTNAME730: "Land Technology Research Useless"
 EVTDESC730: "Several prominent men in our country are pointing out that the path we are going when it comes to army research is utterly foolish and will amount to nothing. They demand that we stop the current approach and stick with what was good enough for our fathers."
 EVTOPTA730: "They have a point!"
 EVTOPTB730: "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME731: "Naval Research Wrong!"
 EVTDESC731: "It seems as if a leading shipwright in our country has written a very convincing document detailing how the new ship technology that his rival has been trying to get funding for will never work, and may even cause the ships to sink before they leave the harbor."
 EVTOPTA731: "They must be right!"
 EVTOPTB731: "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME732: "New Trade Research is Heretical"
 EVTDESC732: "We have had complaints from several dignitaries in our country that the new practices of our merchants are clearly heretical, and that we should put a stop to them."

 flavor_hm1.1.desc: "Not long time ago our ghost scouts have discovered a mysterious tower on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. From the beginning we had no insight of its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which is already met its final demise being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only one floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers have found a very valuable item - notes of the Master of this tower, none other then La Croix herself, a sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in original history which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further world will deviate from the original history the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct history doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox and prevent the worlds from desintegration leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"

At first we had no insight as to its origin and purpose, but after some thorough investigation we found out the multifunctional purpose of this place. The Administrator Tower is an object from the parallel world which already met its final demise by being swallowed by the Chaos. This tower served as a research center, living place for refugees, greenhouse for the remaining flora, an arc for all the world's knowledge and an impenetrable fortress.\nAlthough some of our exploring parties were hindered by the artificial monsters guarding this tower, we managed to uncover some of its secrets and glimpses of the history of the dying world. Only a single floor and the Tower's basement weren't covered in debris and due to causal effect were transferred to our world. Among the remaining floors one of our ghost girl researchers has found a very valuable item - notes from the Master of this tower, none other than La Croix herself, the sister of Chrome.\nThose notes contain very sophisticated formulae and research regarding the apoptosis effect, chaos spread and its original cause - the paradox in the original timeline which led to the creation of all the parallel worlds. According to the notes, the further a world will deviate from the original timeline the sooner it will be led towards its demise. On the other hand, even following the correct timeline doesn't prevent the world from disappearing, it only slows chaotization significantly. The notes didn't provide any information on how to fix the paradox or prevent the worlds from disintegration, leaving our scientists in a depressed state of mind. But maybe there are other smart people around in this world? If only Chrome could meet her missing sister La Croix Shirome from our world...\nLa Croix hadn't been in contact with her for a long time since the failed experiment when Shirome almost died protecting her sister from an explosion caused by Chrome's own mistake. But now, when we have an invaluable proof of grave calamity waiting for our world and chaos research done in a great detail with results which could be obtained only in a dying world, she must listen!"

Recently it's been thoroughly investigated by a group of researchers from Iliasburg and Iliasport. The Alliance of Wisdom society has managed to gather even more information on this subject. Not only apoptosis beings and makina found there, but also a peculiar interdimensional door. According to them this door may lead to a parallel world where the Goddess Ilias performed so-called 'Re-creation Plan' essentially wiping monsters and humans for good."
 HOLY_SITE_550_DESC: "Ancient Lab Facility is a well-hidden place, disguised by San Ilia church under the name of 'Ancient Temple'. A lot of data regarding apoptosis effect and chimera monsters was thoroughly studied in that place, though it seems most of important information including the researchers' names was erased. Nevertheless, we still might find something of interest."
 HOLY_SITE_971_DESC: "Sabasa Tartarus is a very remote place in the middle of wastelands which hasn't been properly investigated by humans. As usual Apoptosis are restless in that area, abnormalities in the scarce wildlife and flora are observed. According to our researchers, the world behind the interdimesional door may as well be drawing it's final breath... If it didn't meet its demise already."
 HOLY_SITE_209_DESC: "In the year of 1454 the mysterious object of 'Administrator Tower' has appeared on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. Judging from the observations of this place it used to be a shelter of the remaining survivors from the parallel world. Artificial monsters used to fight off the apoptosis, refugees and scientists have lived in the residential areas on the upper floors. After the teleportation to our world the upper floors got caught in debris. It is safe to assume that this world has been covered in chaos, perhaps high-ranking XX-class Apoptosis is to blame..."

 HOLY_SITE_1856_DESC: "Gold Tartarus is a remote land in the Western Gold Region hidden behind the Nightmare Wastes. Inhospitable environment and the sheer distance to the closest human settlement also didn't help in investigation, as the Gold Tartarus wasn't explored at all. Though some visitors did manage to get inside that hole and found another interdimensional door. According to rumours, their lies a world afew hundred years ago, the world of the Black Alice and Legendary hero Heinrich."
