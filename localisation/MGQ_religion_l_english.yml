 HOLY_SITE_58_DESC: "Southern Ilias Continent Tartarus is yet another mysterious rift which appeared after the Great Disaster. Recently it's been thoroughly investigated by a group of researchers from Iliasburg and Iliasport. The Alliance of Wisdom society has managed to gather even more information on this subject. Not only apoptosis beings and makina found there, but also a peculiar interdimensional door. According to them this door may lead to a parallel world where the Goddess Ilias performed so-called 'Re-creation Plan' essentially wiping monsters and humans for good."
 HOLY_SITE_550_DESC: "Ancient Lab Facility is a well-hidden place, disguised by San Ilia church under the name of 'Ancient Temple'. A lot of data regarding apoptosis effect and chimera monsters was thoroughly studied in that place, though it seems most of important information including the researchers' names was erased. Nevertheless, we still might find something of interest."
 HOLY_SITE_971_DESC: "Sabasa Tartarus is a very remote place in the middle of wastelands which hasn't been properly investigated by humans. As usual Apoptosis are restless in that area, abnormalities in the scarce wildlife and flora are observed. According to our researchers, the world behind the interdimesional door may as well be drawing it's final breath... If it didn't meet its demise already."
 HOLY_SITE_209_DESC: "In the year of 1454 the mysterious object of 'Administrator Tower' has appeared on the island next to the Safina Tartarus. Judging from the observations of this place it used to be a shelter of the remaining survivors from the parallel world. Artificial monsters used to fight off the apoptosis, refugees and scientists have lived in the residential areas on the upper floors. After the teleportation to our world the upper floors got caught in debris. It is safe to assume that this world has been covered in chaos, perhaps high-ranking XX-class Apoptosis is to blame..."
 HOLY_SITE_1766_DESC: "La Croix is one of the most prominent members of the Alliance of Wisdom. For a lond time she has been conducting her notorious necromantic practices and studied the natural laws of this world. Knowledge of the Necromancer Succubus of Artiste family line will be crucial in the pursuit of truth."
 HOLY_SITE_1856_DESC: "Gold Tartarus is a remote land in the Western Gold Region hidden behind the Nightmare Wastes. Inhospitable environment and the sheer distance to the closest human settlement also didn't help in investigation, as the Gold Tartarus wasn't explored at all. Though some visitors did manage to get inside that hole and found another interdimensional door. According to rumours, their lies a world afew hundred years ago, the world of the Black Alice and Legendary hero Heinrich."
 HOLY_SITE_2274_DESC: "Hellgondo Tartarus located in a former place of Remina, where the Great Disaster occured. Being relatively close to the Monster Lord Castle this place is apparently well-observed by the Monster Lord. According to our informants the interdimensional door inside this rift should lead to the world ruled by the Dark Goddess Alipheese I."

 ###ROGUE MAGICRAFT PLACES OF RESEARCH###
 HOLY_SITE_715_DESC: "Puppeteer Tower is a mysterious, isolated place where the rogue puppeteer Kagetsumugi crafts her unique dolls of unparalleled quality.
