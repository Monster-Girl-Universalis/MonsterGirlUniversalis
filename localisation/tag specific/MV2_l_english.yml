###MISSIONS FOR MAGISTEA###
  MV2_saloon_unification_title:0 "Saloon Unification"
  MV2_saloon_unification_desc:0 "After our initial campaigns against the monster girls on Saloon Hill and successful operations against the Scale Bandits, we now control most of the territory surrounding the city of Saloon and its nearby towns. With the Magistean military strengthened through these campaigns, we can now consider securing the lucrative trade routes to the south."
  MV2_richest_trade_city_title:0 "Richest Trading City"
  MV2_richest_trade_city_desc:0 "South of Saloon lies a region of desert and savanna, and at its heart stands the continent’s richest trading city — an economic hub that connects trade routes not only from the Safina and Natalia landmasses but from nearly the entire world. If we manage to secure this vital center of commerce, Magistea will never again struggle with money or resources."
  MV2_challenge_sabasa_title:0 "Challenge Sabasa"
  MV2_challenge_sabasa_desc:0 "Centuries ago, when we were a small, inward-looking village, we existed as an autonomous region under the Sabasa Kingdom. However, decentralization and self-governance led only to stagnation and decline — a dark age. Now that we have risen and begun consolidating power under a new Magistean order, the central authority in Sabasa views our ambitions in Grandeur with growing hostility. A greater confrontation is inevitable, and we must be ready."
  MV2_decisive_victory_over_sabasa_title:0 "Decisive Magistean Victory"
  MV2_decisive_victory_over_sabasa_desc:0 "With Sabasa defeated and its central authority dismantled, Magistea stands triumphant. Our rise from obscurity is now complete, and we claim our rightful place as a dominant power in the region. The era of Magistean greatness begins now."
  MV2_fight_the_piracy_title:0 "Fight the Piracy"
  MV2_fight_the_piracy_desc:0 "To the north of Saloon lies the Great Pirate Cave, where a group of mermaids calling themselves the Fishy Pirates have established their lair. Though they claim to target only other criminals, their presence has disrupted the entire Inner Seas region. We can no longer tolerate seafaring raiders near our shores. It is time to launch a proper naval punitive expedition."
  MV2_settle_the_islands_title:0 "Settle the Islands"
  MV2_settle_the_islands_desc:0 "Scattered around our continent lie several uninhabited islands to the west and north. By settling them, we could capitalize on their natural resources and potentially uncover ancient artifacts of great interest to Magistea."
  MV2_arcane_empire_title:0 "Arcane Empire"
  MV2_arcane_empire_desc:0 "Having united most of the Safina continent, we have surpassed the Sabasa Kingdom and emerged as a true regional power. The time has come to proclaim the Arcane Empire of Magistea — an enlightened realm built on magical might and sovereign ambition."
  MV2_earth_spirit_ruins_title:0 "Earth Spirit Ruins"
  MV2_earth_spirit_ruins_desc:0 "In the northeastern part of Safina lie the ancient Safar Ruins. Now inhabited by various desert-dwelling monsters, the ruins are centered around the dwelling place of the Earth Spirit. Further west lies a dead swamp surrounding the enigmatic Safina Tartarus — an area riddled with anomalies and an island crowned by the ominous Administrator Tower, whose origins remain unknown. We must prepare sufficient resources and skilled researchers to mount a proper expedition into these mysterious lands."
  MV2_followers_of_gnome_title:0 "Followers of Gnome"
  MV2_followers_of_gnome_desc:0 "Our early advances were hindered by hostile monster girls inhabiting the area. To ensure safe passage for scholars and explorers, we must establish secure routes and assert direct control over the region."
  MV2_earth_monsters_title:0 "Earth Monsters"
  MV2_earth_monsters_desc:0 "Antlion and Sandworm girls proved to be formidable adversaries... Yet at last, we have managed to pacify and secure the Safar Ruins. With the region stabilized, magical scholars can now safely visit the Earth Spirit’s domain without further disturbances."
  MV2_safina_tartarus_title:0 "Safina Tartarus"
  MV2_safina_tartarus_desc:0 "Now that we are approaching these peculiar lands, we can begin a proper investigation of the Safina Tartarus. In the past, the Sabasa Kingdom attempted to study the rift, but their efforts ended in failure. By learning from their mistakes and preparing the necessary equipment, we may succeed where they did not. If we delve deep enough, we might even uncover how to utilize the strange things that dwell within..."
