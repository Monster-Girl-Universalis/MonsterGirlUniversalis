#Branch 1

 WLR_mini_title: "Steal the Phoenix Tails"
 WLR_mini_desc: "The rumours were true! Don Dahlia had a Phoenix tail trade in the slums! Good riddance! While hunting the phoenix girl may be tempting, it would be poor sport with her being so small, plus we'll get more feathers if we hire her."

 WLR_thinking_title: "Melting Pot of Ideas"
 WLR_thinking_desc: "Iliasburg is the center of economic wealth on this continent, as such not only do food and weapons come through but also many new ideas from human merchants travel around. We should lend an ear to this wisdom."

 WLR_meat_title: "Midas Meat"
 WLR_meat_desc: "As carnivores a steady supply of meat is vital to our health and morale. The livestock present in Midas Village seems to be just what we need to secure our food needs."

WLR_beast_queen_title: "Claim the Beast Throne"
WLR_beast_queen_desc: "The position of beast queen is currently vacant, right now we are grown into such a powerful state that no other beast  would dare challenge us if our great $MONARCH$ claimed the title for herself!"

#Branch 2

 WLR_irina_title: "Take Over the Slums"
 WLR_irina_desc: "In the south of our realm lies human slums, while the area itself is quite poor compared to inland human settlements, it remains an opportunity for expansion. Bringing this area under our rule will ensure that our southern border will be safe from any invader thanks to the Enrika Mountains, and it will allow us to explore the enigmatic Mithra Castle in the future. Besides that there are rumours of phoenix tail trading going on thanks to Don Dahlia. We'd be able to buy a lot of meat with a new source of income..."

 WLR_sheep_title: "The Perfect Prey"
 WLR_sheep_desc: "The city of Iliasburg and its riches are ours. That's not the most important thing right now! The Sheep girls are within our grasp. Our predator instincts rampage in our minds..."

 WLR_bucket_of_chicken_title: "Poultry Hunting"
 WLR_bucket_of_chicken_desc: "With the sheep herd under our guidance we can focus our attention to our west where the harpies and sparrow girls reside. Beyond them lies Midas Village with its meat industry too...We've got quite the juicy targets."

 WLR_midas_title: "Devour Midas"
 WLR_midas_desc: "Midas Village has a strong tradition of animal husbandry which we carnivores can take advantage of!"

WLR_adm_reform_title: "Reform Wolf Administration"
WLR_adm_reform_desc: "Winning battles and conquering land is easy, holding onto that land is the real test of strength. Reforming our administration into something more adaptable will ensure we do not collapse under the weight of our own conquests."

#Branch 3

WLR_dominance_title: "Assert Our Dominance"
WLR_dominance_desc: "Battle is in the blood of beast monsters, and that holds true especially for us wolves. Humans and other monsters battle each other for gain, whether for land or coin, we on the other hand, will show everyone around usthat we will draw blood just to remind them who's on top of the food chain!"

WLR_mountain_pass_title: "Irina Chokepoint"
WLR_mountain_pass_desc: "There's only one way out of the Irina region connecting to the rest of the continent, now that this vital chokepoint is ours we can both concentrate the defense of our territory and expand outward. It just so happens that the great and wealthy Iliasburg is next door, beating them won't be easy, but that just makes the hunt more thrilling!"

WLR_iliasville_title: "Raid Ilias Temple"
WLR_iliasville_desc: "Iliasville is the home of a temple dedicated to the Goddess of Light Ilias which used to be the site of baptisms for heroes. But the glory days of the temple are long gone now that the faith in Ilias and her commandments is wavering. We will conquer this fallen temple in honor of our god Fenrir!"

WLR_slimes_title: "Slime Prowess"
WLR_slimes_desc: "In our wars until now, we never came across an enemy with a burning a spirit as the slimes. Different as they may be, they show potential to master our way of fighting and with the right extracts it can be even easier done than said. As our pack becomes larger and stronger so do our enemies and we now have to face what dwells in the Lost Woods."

WLR_enrika_title: "Hunt Down the Elves"
WLR_enrika_desc: "In the Lost Woods we've come across elves acting as guards for some kind of village, but that doesn't matter to us. What matters is that the lush forest is the perfect location to hunt down and ambush prey!"

WLR_apex_title: "Apex Predators"
WLR_apex_desc: "Praise be Fenrir for your kin have asserted their dominance over the whole of Ilias continent! Now we set our sight on all who oppose us, we shall draw blood and raze their cities to the ground! Blood for the Wolf God!"

WLR_reform_title: "Reform Wolf Society"
WLR_reform_desc: "We wolf girls are smart enough to form societies, but they are very archaic compared to the other monsters and especially the human's. Nature often favors not only the strong and the smart but also those who can better adapt to change, thus we must undertake several reforms to our realm."

WLR_dip_reform_title: "Reform Institutions"
WLR_dip_reform_desc: "Our approach hasn't been the strongest, particularly within our borders... Some of our subjects have described our conquest rhetoric as "Predatory" or "Domineering"... as a society of many different creatures we must put the old ways of thinking aside and come to listen to the voices of the weak, that will in turn make us appear less barbaric to foreigners."

#Branch 4

WLR_we_are_the_rats_title: "Prey Upon the Rats"
WLR_we_are_the_rats_desc: "The rat girls to our north may be fellow beasts, but their lack of resolve makes them weak, which makes them an ideal target for us. "

WLR_caves_title: "Dominate Iliasburg"
WLR_caves_desc:  "We have expanded deep inside Iliasburg's territory, our enemies are bleeding. It is time we put them out of their misery!"

WLR_iliasburg_outskirts_title: "Flush out the Cave Dwellers"
WLR_iliasburg_outskirts_desc: "We have ripped away a decent chunk of Iliasburg's territory for ourselves, now we have access to caves inhabited by monsters. Prey  with their backs against the wall...We can't let this chance go!"

WLR_elves_title: "Elven Hunters"
WLR_elves_desc: "Elves have proven to be skilled hunters with bow and arrow and their knowledge of the forest is quite something. We should honor these great warriors by accepting them fully into our society. After all, what is a hunter if not a deadlier predator?"

WLR_mil_reform_title: "Reform Wolf Army"
WLR_mil_reform_desc: "While our powerful claws are perfect for tearing flesh they aren't as useful against a solid brick wall of a fortress, and our reliance on physical combat has led to our use of machinas to be inadequate to say the least. The progress of the military  is faster than evolution or society', falling behind here will ensure our enemies will defeat us in battle..."

#Branch 5

WLR_pals_title: "Howl Out New Friends"
WLR_pals_desc: "In such a vast world with intricate alliances networks, the lone wolf strategy isn't optimal for survival, we should go for a pack strategy instead"

WLR_kitsu_title: "Fellow Predators"
WLR_kitsu_desc: "We have made contact with several Kitsunes in one of the caves system we conquered, they're young and inexperienced but as fellow canined predators we should bond with them and allow their pack to merge with ours."

WLR_navy_1_title: "Dominate the Waves"
WLR_navy_1_desc: "The sea is full of opportunities for catches for those who know how to hunt in it, however we can't let the change in medium stop us from the thrill of the hunt!"

WLR_navy_2_title: "Quest for Seafood"
WLR_navy_2_desc: "We aren't sure our navy has gained the experience necessary to propagate our influence through the waves, but what better trial by fire is there than challenging Kraken herself?"

WLR_mercenary_title: "Wolf Mercenaries"
WLR_mercenary_desc: "Wolf girls are notorious all over the world for their mercenary work, with how many of them return alive and rich home we should leverage their experience and contacts in the field to get the best deals out of our mercenary companies."

WLR_fenrir_title: "Fenrir's Legacy"
WLR_fenrir_desc: "Wolf Girls are the only followers of Fenrir in the entire world, and our prideful mercenaries know that very well: wherever they go they try to spread the faith in Fenrir. We cannot be outdone by our very people like this, we should follow their example and spread the faith to our conquered foes!"

#Events

flavor_wlr.1_title: "The Queen Beast Among Us"
flavor_wlr.1_desc: "$MONARCH$ is unparalleled in leading the pack. Her name strikes fear into our enemies and admiration into her fellow beast kin.

flavor_wlr.4_title: "Exploration of the forbidden Castle"

For this reason we have sent scouts who specialize in the thief job to check the inside of the castle and recover anything useful from its interior, all was found were some valuable chests and several altars with names written on them.
