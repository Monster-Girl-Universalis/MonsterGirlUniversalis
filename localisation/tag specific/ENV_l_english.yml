Meanwhile, East Ilias Tartarus leads to a world similar to our own, but a few years behind, where Rostrum village has yet to be destroyed.\nWhat should we do?\nWe can focus on analyzing the data from the world destroyed by the angels to prepare powerful countermeasures for war against the Goddess. \n§GThis path will grant military buffs for the nobility, which could prove invaluable in the war to come.§!\nAlternatively, we could uncover the secrets of refining magic stones and mass-produce them. \n§GThis would provide military buffs for the burgher estate, enabling us to equip certain elemental stones.§!"

Ilias stands there, weakened, her body slowly eroding from the chaos. For all those years after the Great Disaster, she had used her goddess powers to hold back the otherworldly erosion. But now, her power seems to be running out.\nSuddenly, a party of heroes, led by Luka, unexpectedly appears at the final layer of the Temple Ruins, accompanied by two groups: the Lilith Sisters from the Demon World and Seraphs from the Angel World. After that...\nNone of our soldiers seem to remember what happened next. It was as if time had frozen, but everyone remembers an ominous feeling, as though the world had almost been destroyed. The same sense of dread one experiences deep in the Tartarus rifts, fighting the strongest types of Apoptosis.\nBefore us stand Luka, his childhood friend Sonya, and the other party members. The Goddess Ilias is no more, but it seems a great threat has been averted as the otherworldly erosion has stopped spreading. The young hero refuses to talk about what happened during that time, but it seems everything has been resolved."
