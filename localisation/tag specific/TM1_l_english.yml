  TM1_legitimize_our_rule_title:0 "Legitimize our Rule"
  TM1_legitimize_our_rule_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Witch Hunt turmoil, our faction has only recently broken away from Lily's forces. While all our members share a common belief that the destructive power of worm summoning must be supervised and controlled, Lucia remains a new and untested ruler, whereas Lily is of noble birth. Our lady must now solidify her legitimacy and gain the people's recognition."

  TM1_open_lucias_research_center_title:0 "Lucia's Research Center"

  TM1_hire_elite_oni_commander_title:0 "Elite Oni Commander"
  TM1_hire_elite_oni_commander_desc:0 "Among the oni mercenaries, there are whispers of a legendary wandering commander. She shares our values, fully aware of the chaos that unrestrained power can bring. With her guidance and strength, our army will become a disciplined and principled force."
  TM1_northern_yoma_title:0 "Northern Yoma"
  TM1_northern_yoma_desc:0 "To the north of Magistea lies a warlike tribe of yoma fighters. With our village now unified and protected by sea and mountains on most sides, this northern frontier remains our only vulnerable border. We must secure it before any threat emerges."
  TM1_saloon_hill_title:0 "Saloon Hill"
  TM1_saloon_hill_desc:0 "At the northernmost edge of the Safina continent lies Saloon Hill — a harsh, arid land populated by scattered monster tribes. Now that Lady Lucia has brought order to Magistea, we must turn outward and extend civilization to these untamed frontiers."
  TM1_saloon_campaigns_title:0 "Saloon Campaigns"

  TM1_lilys_faction_title:0 "Lily's Faction"
  TM1_lilys_faction_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the rebellion against our abusers, chaos reigned. Lawless lynchings claimed countless lives at the hands of Lily’s army. Lucia quickly realized how dangerous unrestricted access to powerful magic, learnable even by children could be. Yet her closest friend Lily refused to see reason. Instead, she began speaking of 'voices of the oppressed' and her mission to liberate the weak across the world. This madness must be stopped. Sooner or later, our dissident faction will clash with hers."
  TM1_continuation_war_title:0 "Continuation War"

###FLAVOR FOR TOWER OF MAGIC###

 flavor_TM1.1.t:0 "Lucia's Isolation"
 flavor_TM1.1.desc:0 "For a long time, the former Witch Hunt village was ruled by a group of cruel, abusive men who turned the lives of local women into a living hell.\nNot long ago, Lily the daughter of a local noble and a secret student of magical science discovered a powerful technique known as 'worm summoning'. It was a shortcut to power, a force that allowed the weak to strike back against their tormentors with overwhelming might. What followed was a massive uprising and a wave of brutal lynchings. While many worm summoners celebrated their liberation, others were appalled by the chaos. Among them was Lucia, who formed a faction committed to strictly regulating the spread of tentacle magic.\nAs tensions grew between former comrades, dissidents opposed to Lily’s rule joined Lucia, establishing their base in the Tower of Magic. Once a remote and semi-autonomous village on the fringes of the Sabasa Kingdom, Magistea became even more isolated from the outside world. Trade collapsed, diplomatic missions ceased, and distrust between the two factions deepened. A full-scale civil war now looms on the horizon..."
 flavor_TM1.1.a:0 "The horror!"
 flavor_TM1.2.t:0 "Magistea Unification"
 flavor_TM1.2.desc:0 "Lucia has succeeded in reuniting Magistea, but it came at a cost. The chaos unleashed by unrestricted worm summoning has been brought under control, and Lady Lucia's vision of a disciplined, ethical use of magic now guides the land. The Tower of Magic stands firm as a symbol of reason amidst past madness. Though Lily was once a dear friend, her descent into delusion and fanaticism could not be left unchecked. Now, with order restored and dangerous magics curtailed, Magistea can finally begin to heal. A wiser, more cautious future lies ahead."
 flavor_TM1.2.a:0 "Peace at last"
